We use Netflix as an example of the problem statement. 

Netflix solved the problem people had with having to leave their homes and finding the nearest video store to buy or rent a movie. Netflix aimed to make video stores obsolete and instead deliver movies in an envelope to your mailbox, allowing you to keep the movie as long as you would like.

While Netflix’s services and products have changed dramatically, the initial simplified problem statement could be presented as the following:

> ”Heading out to a video store is a hassle. People dislike having to go out to a video store just to rent a movie and having to pay fees for returning a movie late.”

The problem statement above is simplified and short, it is accurate. It does not include any reference to a solution. The problem statement should only focus on what the **name implies**, the problem.

A proper problem statement has much more character attached to it.

- It is supposed to tell a story and convey emotion to the reader so that the reader truly feels attached to whatever solution is provided.
- Building a better story will take more time and effort but is likely to provide great results as the startup’s solution to a problem will be perceived as being necessary.

## Picking the most important problem

Nonetheless, the problem statement should focus on **just the single most important problem**. 

Reasons

- For an investor to remember and feel a connection with your startup idea, you would need to do the above-mentioned, convince the investor of the significance of the problem the startup is aiming to solve.
- What’s important is not the number of problems a startup can solve, it is the weight of a particular problem and how well the startup can solve it.
- If the most important problem is not able to convince the investor, it is very unlikely that the other problems a startup aims to solve will be able to do so.

*For instance, in the Netflix example, the delivery of movies solves several different problems, convenience, cost-effectiveness, movie selection, and several others. if Netflix was much cheaper than it’s competitors, but less convenient, you could argue that Netflix would have failed. What truly separated Netflix from video stores was the **convenience** factor. Therefore, the convenience factor has more weight to it and should be the lead problem.*

This does not mean that the other problems should be ignored, those should be mentioned as well. Nevertheless, the initial focus should be on the lead problem, the other related problems can be addressed later.

## Increasing the value of the lead problem

Some problems have more value than others, the value of the problem is derived from how inconvenient and painful the problem is. The higher the value of the problem, the higher the value of the solution.

*For example, the two versions of the Netflix problem statement below.*

1. *Going to the video store is a hassle*
2. *Going to the video store requires sitting in traffic, searching through the video store aisles for movies and waiting in long lines just to get a single movie.*

While both the statements aim to describe the same problem, 

- the first statement lacks the details and experiences that add value to the problem. 

- the second one will make you think of sitting in traffic, going through aisles and waiting in lines, simple but negative experiences almost everyone can relate to. 

  These details project an image to the audience of how something as simple as heading to the video store can be a miserable experience which needs a solution.

## Making the story more relatable

To increase the impact your problem statement has on the audience, ensuring the audience can relate to your story is critical.

Methods to establish an attachment between the audience and a product/service

- **Create an attachment is by creating a character for your story**

  - in the Netflix case, you could start a story with: 

    > “This is John, he likes to watch movies every weekend but hates heading out to the video store every week.” 

    A persona like this is used in many explanatory videos to simplify the story and to make it more relatable. Personas serve the same purpose in problem statements.

-  **Become the main character of your story**

  If the problem stated has affected you personally and you can convey to your audience how and what exactly happened, you and your startup become the focal point for your audience to relate to.

- **If the problem allows it, creating a character would not be necessary at all as the problem is so common and relatable that most of the audience can relate to it naturally.**
