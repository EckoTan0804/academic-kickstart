## What is JTBD?

Every time she begins the process of evolving herself, she has a **Job to be Done**.

Jobs to be Done is a theory of consumer action. It describes [the mechanisms](https://jtbd.info/the-jobs-to-be-done-data-model-b270f6fc445) that cause a consumer to adopt an innovation.

The theory states that markets grow, evolve, and renew whenever customers have a Job to be Done, and then buy a product to complete it (get the Job Done). This makes a Job to be Done a process: it starts, it runs, and it ends. The key difference, however, is that a **JTBD describes how a customer changes or wishes to change**. With this in mind, we define a **JTBD** as follows:

> A Job to be Done is the process a consumer goes through whenever she aims to change her existing life-situation into a preferred one, but cannot because there are constraints that stop her.

### Products enable customers to get a Job Done

A customer can’t complete a JTBD by himself. He needs a product to help him design, construct, and complete it.

### What isn’t a Job to be Done

- **The biggest mistake is thinking of a Job to be Done as an activity or task**

- Another common mistake is to think that there are types of Jobs

Keep in mind that a Job to be Done describe the “better me.” It answers the question, “How are you better since you started using [product]?”



## Why Is It Called “Jobs to be Done”?

**The product does the work, while the consumer enjoys the benefits**![Image for post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/1*GFS-4tbPSsmpw0SlXUKKjw.jpeg)

**Jobs To Be Done**

- **Job**
  - consumers hire and fire products to help them achieve progress. 
  - Also like the employer/employee relationship, the product does the work, while the consumer enjoys the benefits of that work.
- **to be**
  - When something doesn’t exist yet, we can say it is *to be.* 
  - A Job to be Done, then, is to create a life-situation that doesn’t exist yet.
- **Done**. 
  - When I hire a product and make the progress I desire, then the Job is *Done*.

### Job

It’s also a valuable insight into innovation and consumer motivation. People don’t want to do *work* or *tasks*. That’s the whole purpose of innovation! We create technologies to do the things we don’t want to do, so we can have more time to do the things we want to do.

#### **→ Takeaway**

The “Job” metaphor in JTBD is meant to evoke the idea of an employer hiring an employee to do work. When applied to innovation: **consumers “hire” products to do the work of helping them make progress; the product does the work, while the consumer enjoys the benefits (progress)**. If the product can deliver those benefits, the consumer will continue to employ it. If it cannot, the consumer fires it, and something else is considered.

### “to be”: creating something that doesn’t exist yet

The purpose of the phrase “to be” is to denote this idea of creating something that does not exist yet.

#### → Takeaway

The “to be” part of Jobs to be Done aims to evoke the idea of a desired future. When applied to innovation: **the Job to be Done should describe the consumer in the future (i.e. the future “to be” created), not how the consumer is today or what they do today**.

### **“Done”:** When the desired progress is achieved

Here’s another critical point about Jobs to be Done: **JTBD is about consumers making a change; and when that desired change happens, the Job is Done.** It’s that simple.

#### → Takeaway

The “Done” part of Jobs to be Done illustrates the idea that a JTBD is a process of change, and when that change is done, demand for a product also dissipates. When applied to innovation: **a Job to be Done ends when the consumer makes the progress they desire.**
