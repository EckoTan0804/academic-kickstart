**Business model**: How a company **creates value for itself** while delivering products or services for customers 

## 1. Customer segments

>  ***"Who are my customers, and why would they buy my product?"***

We need to figure out

- geographic 
- social characteristics
- demographics

so that we could have a picture/archetyp of the persona.

There are some customer groups that should be considered for a software business:

- Device type
- Top purchases
- Visitor tiers

## 2. Value proposition

>  ***"What are you building, and for whom?"***

The Value Proposition is the reason for a customer to buy your product. **A good Value Proposition is a unique combination of features that will either solve a customer’s problem or bring them additional value.**

- The Value Proposition should be short. 
  - Make sure both you and your users can read it in less than 5 seconds and clearly understand what your product is all about. 
  - Drop vague descriptions and jargon!
- You should have different Value Propositions for each Customer Segment.



## 3. Channels

>  ***"How does the product get from our company to the customer?"***

The Channels element reflects how a company aims at delivering Value Proposition to its Customer Segments. Moreover,  they can also create brand awareness and provide post-purchase customer support.

Five phases of channels development

![Five Channel Phases - outline distribution channels](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/channels.png)

- **Raising awareness**: let your potential users know about your product
  - Blogging and social media
  - Word of mouth 
- **Evaluating your Value Proposition**: How can customers find your proposition helpful?
  - Hands-on experience (try-before-you-buy technique)
  - Case studies and reviews
- **Purchasing methods**
- **Delivering the product**
- **Post-purchase support**: the phase that customers care a lot about
  - Chatbots, simulation
  - Customer surveys, track reviews and questions on social media, or create personal recommendations based on user activity.









## 4. Customer relationships

>  ***"How does a company get, keep, and grow customers?"***

- **Personal assistance**: Make sure your customer can contact you at any time prior to or after the purchase and make the contact channels diverse and accessible
  - via e-mail, phone, or chatbot
  - Dedicated client care workers
- **Self-service**
  - onboarding guide
  - Help Center with FAQs
- **Automated service**
- **Communities**
  - Create a community around a product or a brand where users can exchange knowledge.
- **Co-creation**

## 5. Revenue streams

>  ***"How does the company make money from each custom segment? What value is the customer paying for?"***

Depending on the product or service you are trying to sell, you need to have a clear understanding of the ways you’re going to drive revenue from each Customer Segment.

- **Advertising**
- **Affiliate Marketing**
  - Make commissions by referring other products and services to your audience.
- **Subscriptions**
- **Sponsorship**
- **Freemium**: By attracting an audience to the basic set of features, you provide the paying customers (another Customer Segment) premium features.
- **Fee-based**

## 6. Resources

> ***"What assets are required to make the business model work?"***

Key resources play a direct role in creating your Value Proposition, delivering a service to your Customer Segments, and supporting Customer Relationships.

- **Finance**
  - Bank loans
  - Advances from strategic customers
  - Venture capital investors
  - Self-funded
- **Physical**
  - Manufactoring
  - Buildings
  - facilities
  - Machines
  - Vehicles
  - Tangible resource such as hardware or cooling system
- **Intellectual**
  - patents, copyrights, licenses, and customer knowledge
  - cloud services
- **Human**
  - Software engineers
  - Scientists
  - Marketing specialists
  - Customer service representatives

## 7. Partners

> ***"Who are the key partners and suppliers needed to make the business model work?"***
>
> - ***"What key resources are we acquiring from our partners?"***
> - ***"What key activities do they perform?"***

They could be

- **strategic alliances between non-competitors**
  - The idea behind this partnership is to leverage each other’s resources.
- **joint ventures**:  fill the gap that only another business can fill
- **supplier and buyer**
- **coopetition**: partnership between competitors



## 8. Key activities

> ***"What are the most important things the company must to to make the business model work?"***

Main categories:

- **Production**: selling something
- **Problem solving**: consulting, engineering...
- **Platform**
- **Supply chain management**



## 9. Costs

> ***"What are the costs to operate business model?"***
>
> - ***"What are the most important costs?"***
> - ***"What are the most expensive resources?"***
> - **"What are fix cost?"**
> - **"What are available cost?"**

Delivering Value, maintaining Customer Relationships, and buying Resources all incur costs.

- **Research and development (R&D) costs**
- **Sales and marketing activities**
- **Support costs**
- **Capital costs**: investments that go into acquiring or upgrading physical resources, such as buildings and computers.
- **Overhead costs**: the general operational costs that have no direct impact on delivering a product, such as electricity, or a processing time for installation and testing software.
- **Staff costs**: resources spent on hiring, training, and retaining employees.
