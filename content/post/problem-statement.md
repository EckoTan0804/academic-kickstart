The real talent in all entrepreneurship—not only in tech startups—is **finding the right problem, not building the right solution**. Once the problem is correctly identified and understood, building the right solution that will lead to a good business is much easier.

## The Problem statement canvas

Let's walk through the process of defining problems using a problem pitched by a startup

> “People have a huge problem with traffic in São Paulo. We’re going to build the leading ridesharing app for them.”

It was a good start, but the “problem” with this problem statement is that half of it talks about the solution. I could not really understand who those people were, how huge the problem was, and could not be convinced by yet another “app” solution for a systemic problem. 

 A simple tool for defining problems in the right way is: the **Problem Statement Canvas**.

### Customer type

*"Who has the problem most often?"*

One of the early stage mistakes is not focusing on the right customer, because of the mirage of keeping multiple opportunities open. You want to focus, and find **the 10% of the people for whom the problem is a real pain, not the 90% for whom it’s just a nuisance.**

- Who are they? 
- Where do they live? 
- What is their income? 
- What does their regular day look like? 

You want to understand the customer through a demographic and psychographic lens, using at least 2-3 relevant criteria.

To get back to our initial example, instead of:

> “People in São Paulo”

we successively refined the customer profile to:

> “Young men aged 25–35, with middle-low income, who live in suburban São Paulo and work in a corporate office in the city center.”

### Context

*"When does the problem occur?"*

When does the problem occur? Most of the problems are not permanent, and understanding what triggers them will help you further understand the root cause of the problem. More than this, you will understand what is the window of opportunity—when the problem becomes acute and [most painful for the customer](https://www.metabeta.com/articles/process/how-to-create-a-persona-and-an-end-user-for-your-startup/), and also when he is also most likely to take action (which in the future could be acquiring your solution).

For our startup, the context then became

> “Every workday, in the mornings and evenings, for an average of 2-3 hours per day.”

### Root problem

*"What is the root cause of the problem?"*

Working with the team, we initially came to this refined problem:

> “Are stuck in traffic.”

However, this is NOT the root problem, but rather a complex of symptoms. Identifying the root cause, not the symptoms, is essential to building the right solution.

a technique called **[root cause analysis](http://www.designkit.org/methods/66)** will help us get to the real issue. Focusing on events/consequences that exist and asking *“why is this a problem?”* several times will help you get to the real root cause that you have to address. 

For example, let's say we have a problem: *our car does not start*. 

But that’s NOT really a problem, it’s a symptom. You can usually find the first cause of this problem by asking *“Why?”* The answer is *“The battery is dead.”* Many entrepreneurs will stop here, then embark on a journey of building better car batteries.

By applying the process we get different answers:

- Second why: *The alternator is not functioning*.
- Third why: *The alternator belt has broken*.
- Fourth why: *The alternator belt was well beyond its useful service life and not replaced.*
- Fifth why: *The vehicle was not maintained according to the recommended service schedule. (the root cause).*

We applied the above thought process for initial example:

- First why: Because it takes a long time to get to work
- Second why: Because they are wasting precious time
- Third why: Because they might use that time to do something more valuable
- Fourth why: Because they could earn more money in that time

So the final problem could be stated as:

> “Could do something more valuable in the time they lose in traffic.”

### Emotional impact

*"How does the problem make the custom feel?"*

It’s not enough to understand the problem as a phenomenon or as an event; you also have to consider its emotional impact, because this helps you walk in your customer shoes and understand their behavior. Each problem causes an emotional response (joy, sadness, anger, fear, trust, distrust, surprise, anticipation) and its magnitude is directly linked to the person’s interest in using your solution. Fully understanding these emotions is essential in identifying windows of opportunity and triggers that will make your customers use your solution.

In our initial example, the emotions are 

> *frustration* and *boredom*

### Quantifiable impact

*"What is the measurable impact of the problem?"*

The impact should always be expressed in a currency. These currencies can be [more legible](https://taylorpearson.me/cash/) (money, goods, time) or less legible (energy, health, relationships). Ideally, you would want to express the impact in a currency that is **as legible as possible**, because the impact is more visible in loss of cash, goods or time than the loss of relationships or health. This will also help to communicate it more convincingly to the customer.

![Quantifiable impact](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/currencies.png)

In our case, we identified the impact as being:

> “Lose on average 40 hours per month.”

### Alternative solutions

*"What alternrative ways do customers use to solve the problem?"*

Before jumping to a solution, shouldn’t you look at what your potential customers are doing to treat their pain or some of its symptoms? If what you discovered to be a problem is **really** a problem, your customers are likely to be using different tools and actions, or combinations of them, to ease or manage the pain. **Looking at these alternative solutions and breaking down each of them into pros and cons, will be a great help in identifying opportunities for a painkiller solution.**

Our São Paulo startup identified a few behaviors of which one later became a critical element of formulating their solution:

> “They sign up for Uber but only accept rides when they go to work or come back.”

### Alternative solution disadvantages

*"What are the disadvanatges of the alternative methods customers use?"*

Finding the disadvantages or shortcomings of alternative solutions will help you understand where the [core](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaS9fK1SebA) of your solution (your unfair advantage) resides.

For our team it was easy:

> “Driving for Uber requires you to spend more time waiting for a ride in the area, as the origin and destination of the trip might not coincide with your home-work itinerary.”

### Summarizing them up

At this stage, we can look at the initial statement, which rather sees the systemic size of a problem (very hard to solve):

> “People have a huge problem with traffic in São Paulo. We’re going to build the leading ridesharing app for them.”

Then compare it with the one we came up with after going through this process:

> Every workday, in the mornings and evenings (for an average of 2-3 hours per day),
> young men aged 25–35, with middle-low income, who live in suburban São Paulo and work in a corporate office in the city center
> lose time in traffic instead of doing something more valuable with it.
> This makes them feel frustrated or bored,
> as they lose on average 40 hours per month.
>
> Currently, they might sign up for Uber and accept rides when they go to work or come back.
> However, driving for Uber requires them to spend more time waiting for a ride in the area, as the origin and destination of the trip might not coincide with their home-work itinerary.

Or in the visual problem statement canvas:

What’s even more interesting is that at the intersection of the above areas we will discover some key elements for turning the problem into a viable solution and business

![Problem statement canvas for startups and innovation teams | DE Toolbox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/problem-statement-canvas-3.png)

This process led the São Paulo team to come up with a rather different solution than the initial one they imagined, one which would have been hard to identify without looking at all the above. *The solution was a ride-sharing platform that allowed their customers to generate revenue while driving other people in their neighborhood to work. Unlike Uber, their solution was subscription-based and a very ingenious way of generating not only revenue but also quick growth.*

Maybe, in a few years, this will even solve the systemic traffic problem in São Paulo. But until then, their startup has the change of becoming a profitable business that generates true value for their customer.
