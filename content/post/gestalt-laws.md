## Summary

| Law               | Statement                                                    | Example                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Proximity**     | Things that are close together appear to be more related than things that are spaced farther apart. | ![Source: Andy Rutledge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/proximity-group_0-20200716111725581-20200716111727910-20200716112023812.gif)<br /><br />![Source: Steven Bradley](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/proximity_0-20200716112024603.png) |
| **Common Region** | when objects are located within the same closed region, we perceive them as being grouped together. | ![Source: Smashing Magazine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/common-regions_0-20200716111835635-20200716112018562.png)<br /><br />![Image for post](https://miro.medium.com/max/912/1*VxBcEZmTiwn6GhzMZTcyIw.png) |
| **Similarity**    | when things appear to be similar to each other, we group them together. And we also tend to think they have the same function. | ![Image for post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/1*qnR1RWW8tN-OUfzlUR2ggQ.png) |
| **Closure**       | when we look at a complex arrangement of visual elements, we tend to look for a single, recognizable pattern.<br />A group of elements are often perceived to be a single recognisable form or figure. The Closure also occurs when an object is incomplete, or parts of it are not enclosed. | ![Source: Eduard Volianskyi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/closure-20200716111958107-20200716112000420-20200716112011386-20200716112143643.jpg)<br /><br />![Image for post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/1*LxCr2o4bLGzzZpYp3tPtFw-20200716112147123-20200716112149674.png)<br /><br />![IBM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/ibm-logo-630x252.png) |
| **Symmetry**      | Symmetrical elements tend to perceived as belonging together regardless of their distance, giving us a feeling of solidity and order. | ![Image for post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/1*Y9SGHHx9Q2Dg5R6CUzIVlA.png) |
| **Continuity**    | elements that are arranged on a line or curve are perceived to be more related than elements not on the line or curve. | ![Image for post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/1*qiXDOZnWm_NFprHEcDEp8w.png) |
| **Common Fate**   | Elements moving towards the same direction are perceived as more related than those moving in different directions, or not moving at all. | ![Image for post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/1*idl16iEtKFaMKbIuxn-GaA.png) |
