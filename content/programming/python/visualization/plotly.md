## Dash

![Numfocus - Plotly Dash Logo - 1176x528 PNG Download - PNGkit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/images.png)

[Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash), a member of Plotlyâ€™s open-source tools, is a Open Source Python library for creating **reactive, Web-based** applications. Dash is a user interface library for creating analytical web applications. Those who use Python for data analysis, data exploration, visualization, modelling, instrument control, and reporting will find immediate use for Dash.

### Why is Dash good?

- Dash app code is **declarative** and **reactive**, which makes it easy to build complex apps that contain many interactive elements.
- Every aesthetic element of the app is customizable
- While Dash apps are viewed in the web browser, you do NOT have to write any Javascript or HTML. Dash provides a Python interface to a rich set of interactive web-based components.
- Dash provides a simple reactive decorator for binding your custom data analysis code to your Dash user interface.
- Through these two abstractions â€” Python components and reactive functional decorators â€” Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols that are required to build an interactive web-based application.

Dash is simple enough that you can bind a user interface around your Python code in an afternoon. :clap:

### Architecture

#### Frontend and backend

Dash leverages the power of Flask and React, putting them to work for Python data scientists who may not be expert Web programmers.

- Dash applications are web servers running **[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)** and communicating **JSON** packets over HTTP requests.
- Dashâ€™s frontend renders components using **React.js**
  - Dash components are Python classes that encode the properties and values of a specific React component and that serialize as JSON.
  - The full set of HTML tags, like `<div/>`, `<img/>`, `<table/>` are also rendered dynamically with React and their Python classes are available through the `dash_html_component` library.

#### CSS

CSS and default styles are kept out of the core library for modularity, independent versioning, and to encourage Dash App developers to customize the look-and-feel of their apps.

#### Data Visualization

Dash ships with a Graph component that renders charts with [plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js).

- built on top of D3.js (for publication-quality, vectorized image export) and WebGL (for high performance visualization)

- declarative, open source, fast
- supports a complete range of scientific, financial, and business charts.
- Dashâ€™s Graph element shares the same syntax as the open-source [plotly.py](https://plot.ly/python) library, so you can easily to switch between the two.

## Deployment

If you want to share public Dash apps for free, you can deploy it on [Heroku](www.heroku.com), one of the easiest platforms for deploying and managing public Flask applications.

Check out the tutorial: [Deploying Dash Apps](https://dash.plotly.com/deployment)

### Heroku

**Heroku** is a cloud [platform as a service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) (PaaS) supporting several [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language). It supports supports [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)), [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js), [Scala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)), [Clojure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clojure), [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), [PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP), and [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)). For this reason, Heroku is said to be a [polyglot platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyglot_(computing)) as it has features for a [developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_developer) to build, run and scale applications in a similar manner across most languages.
