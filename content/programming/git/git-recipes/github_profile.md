## What is GitHub Profile README?

- A feature of GitHub
- A personalizable introduction section which allows the user to write details about themselves and showcase on his/her GitHub repository
- Appears at the top of your GitHub home page (above the pinned repositories)

## How to create a GitHub profile README?

1. Create a new repository and name it with the username of your GitHub account
   - After entering the username, GitHub displays a message describing that youâ€™re about to create a GitHub special repository.
2. Add a `README.md` in the repository
3. Write details/interests/skills about yourself in `README.md` 
4. Set the repository **public** if it is private during the development
