## TL;DR

{{< figure src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/transformer.png" title="Transformer" numbered="true" >}}

## High-Level Look

Let‚Äôs begin by looking at the model as a single black box. In a machine translation application, it would take a sentence in one language, and output its translation in another.

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/the_transformer_3.png)

The transformer consists of 

- an encoding componen
- a decoding component
- connections between them

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/The_transformer_encoders_decoders.png)

Let's take a deeper look:

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/The_transformer_encoder_decoder_stack.png)

- The encoding component is a **stack of encoders** (the paper stacks six of them on top of each other ‚Äì there‚Äôs nothing magical about the number six, one can definitely experiment with other arrangements).

- The decoding component is a **stack of decoders of the same number**.

### Encoder

The encoders are all **identical** in structure (yet they do NOT share weights). Each one is composed of two sub-layers:

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Transformer_encoder.png)

- **Self-attention layer**: helps the encoder to look at other words in the input sentence as it encodes a specific word.
- **Feed Forwrd Neural Network (FFNN)**: The exact same feed-forward network is *independently* applied to each position.

### Decoder

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Transformer_decoder.png)

The decoder has both those layers, but between them is an **attention layer** that helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sentence (similar what attention does in [seq2seq models](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/))

## Encoding Component

### How tensors/vectors flow

As is the case in NLP applications in general, we begin by turning each input word into a vector using an [embedding algorithm](https://medium.com/deeper-learning/glossary-of-deep-learning-word-embedding-f90c3cec34ca).

{{< figure src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/embeddings.png" title="Each word is embedded into a vector of size 512. We'll represent those vectors with these simple boxes." numbered="true" >}}

Note that the embedding ONLY happens in the **bottom-most** encoder.

The abstraction that is common to a**ll the encoders is that they receive a list of vectors each of the size 512** (The size of this list is *hyperparameter* we can set ‚Äì basically it would be the length of the longest sentence in our training dataset.)

- In bottom encoder: word embeddings
- In other encoders: output of the encoder that‚Äôs directly below

After embedding the words in our input sequence, each of them flows through each of the two layers of the encoder.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/encoder_with_tensors.png" alt="img" style="zoom:80%;" />

- The word in each position flows through its own path in the encoder. There are dependencies between these paths in the self-attention layer. 
- The feed-forward layer does not have those dependencies, thus the various paths can be executed in **parallel** while flowing through the feed-forward layer. :clap:

In summary, An encoder

1. receives a list of vectors as input
2. processes this list by passing these vectors into a ‚Äòself-attention‚Äô layer, then into a feed-forward neural network
3. sends out the output upwards to the next encoder.

### Self-Attention

Say the following sentence is an input sentence we want to translate:

‚Äù`The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired`‚Äù

What does ‚Äúit‚Äù in this sentence refer to? Is it referring to the street or to the animal? It‚Äôs a simple question to a human, but not as simple to an algorithm.

As the model processes each word (each position in the input sequence), self attention allows it to look at other positions in the input sequence for clues that can help lead to a better encoding for this word. Therefore, when the model is processing the word ‚Äúit‚Äù, self-attention allows it to associate ‚Äúit‚Äù with ‚Äúanimal‚Äù. 

We can think of how maintaining a hidden state allows an RNN to incorporate its representation of previous words/vectors it has processed with the current one it‚Äôs processing. **Self-attention is the method the Transformer uses to bake the ‚Äúunderstanding‚Äù of other relevant words into the one we‚Äôre currently processing.**

{{< figure src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_self-attention_visualization.png" title="When encoding the word 'it' in 5.encoder (the top encoder in the stack), part of the attention mechanism was focusing on 'The Animal', and baked a part of its representation into the encoding of 'it'." numbered="true" >}}

#### Self-Attention in Detail

Calculate self-attention using vectors:

1. **Create three vectors** 

   - **Query vector**
   - **Key vector**
   - **Value vector**

   **from each of the encoder‚Äôs input vectors** by multiplying the embedding by three matrices that we trained during the training process.

   ![Êà™Â±è2020-08-23 12.23.41](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-08-23%2012.23.41.png)

   These new vectors are smaller in dimension (64) than the embedding vector (512). *They don‚Äôt have to be smaller, this is an architecture choice to make the computation of multiheaded attention (mostly) constant.*

{{% alert note %}} 

In the following steps we will keep using the first word "Thinking" as example.

{{% /alert %}} 

2. **calculate a score**

   - **The score determines how much focus to place on other parts of the input sentence as we encode a word at a certain position.**

     - Say we‚Äôre calculating the self-attention for the first word in this example, ‚ÄúThinking‚Äù. We need to score each word of the input sentence against this word.

       

   - The score is calculated by taking the dot product of the <span style="color:purple">query vector</span> with the <span style="color:orange">key vector</span> of the respective word we‚Äôre scoring. 

     - So if we‚Äôre processing the self-attention for the word in position \#1, the first score would be the dot product of <span style="color:purple">q1</span> and <span style="color:orange">k1</span>. The second score would be the dot product of <span style="color:purple">q1</span> and <span style="color:orange">k2</span>.

     ![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/transformer_self_attention_score.png)

3. **Divide the scores by the square root of the dimension of the key vectors**

   - In paper the dimension of the key vectors is 64. Therefore devide the scores by 8

     (There could be other possible values here, but this is the default)

   - This leads to having more stable gradients. :clap:

4. **Pass the result through a softmax operation**

   - Softmax normalizes the scores so they‚Äôre all positive and add up to 1.
   - The softmax score determines **how much each word will be expressed at this position**. 
     - Clearly the word at this position will have the highest softmax score
     - but sometimes it‚Äôs useful to attend to another word that is relevant to the current word.

   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/self-attention_softmax.png" alt="img" style="zoom:80%;" />

5. **Multiply each value vector by the softmax score** (in preparation to sum them up)
   - Keep intact the values of the word(s) we want to focus on
   - drown-out irrelevant words *(by multiplying them by tiny numbers like 0.001, for example)*

6. **Sum up the weighted value vectors**

   - This produces the output of the self-attention layer at this position (for the first word).
   - The resulting vector is one we can send along to the feed-forward neural network.

   ![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/self-attention-output.png)

#### Matrix Calculation of Self-Attention

In the actual implementation, the above calculation is done in matrix form for faster processing. 

1. **Calculate the Query, Key, and Value matrices**

   ![Êà™Â±è2020-08-23 13.03.34](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-08-23%2013.03.34.png)

   - Pack our embeddings into a matrix <span style="color:#70BF41">X</span>
   - Multiplying it by the weight matrices we‚Äôve trained (<span style="color:#B36AE2">WQ</span>, <span style="color:#F39019">WK</span>, <span style="color:#5CBCE9">WV</span>)

2. **Calculate the outputs of the self-attention layer**

   ![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/self-attention-matrix-calculation-2.png)

### "Multi-headed" Mechanism

The paper further refined the self-attention layer by adding a mechanism called ‚Äú**multi-headed‚Äù attention**. This improves the performance of the attention layer in two ways:

- Expands the model‚Äôs ability to focus on different positions

- Gives the attention layer multiple ‚Äúrepresentation subspaces‚Äù

  - With multi-headed attention we have not only one, but multiple sets of Query/Key/Value weight matrices

    *(the Transformer uses eight attention heads, so we end up with eight sets for each encoder/decoder)*

  - Each of these sets is randomly initialized.
  - After training, each set is used to project the input embeddings (or vectors from lower encoders/decoders) into a different representation subspace.

  {{< figure src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/transformer_attention_heads_qkv.png" title="With multi-headed attention, we maintain separate Q/K/V weight matrices for each head resulting in different Q/K/V matrices. As we did before, we multiply X by the WQ/WK/WV matrices to produce Q/K/V matrices." numbered="true" >}}

If we do the same self-attention calculation as above, just eight different times with different weight matrices, we end up with eight different Z matrices

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/transformer_attention_heads_z.png)

Since the feed-forward layer is expecting a single matrix (a vector for each word), we concat the matrices then multiple them by an additional weights matrix WO.

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/transformer_attention_heads_weight_matrix_o.png)

#### Summarize them into a figure

### Representing The Order of The Sequence Using Positional Encoding

In order to represent the order of the words in the input sequence, the transformer adds a vector to each input embedding.

- These vectors follow a specific pattern that the model learns, which helps it determine the position of each word, or the distance between different words in the sequence.
- Intuition: adding these values to the embeddings provides meaningful distances between the embedding vectors once they‚Äôre projected into Q/K/V vectors and during dot-product attention.

{{< figure src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_vectors.png" title="To give the model a sense of the order of the words, we add positional encoding vectors -- the values of which follow a specific pattern." numbered="true" >}}

For instance, if we assumed the embedding has a dimensionality of 4, the actual positional encodings would look like this:

{{< figure src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_example.png" title="A real example of positional encoding with a toy embedding size of 4" numbered="true" >}}

What might this pattern look like?

In the following figure, each row corresponds the a positional encoding of a vector. 

- The first row would be the vector we‚Äôd add to the embedding of the first word in an input sequence. 
- Each row contains 512 values ‚Äì each with a value between 1 and -1. 

{{< figure src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_positional_encoding_large_example.png" title="A real example of positional encoding for 20 words (rows) with an embedding size of 512 (columns). You can see that it appears split in half down the center. That's because the values of the left half are generated by one function (which uses sine), and the right half is generated by another function (which uses cosine). They're then concatenated to form each of the positional encoding vectors." numbered="true" >}}

### The Residuals

Each sub-layer (self-attention, FFNN) in each encoder has a residual connection around it, and is followed by a [layer-normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06450) step.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_2.png" alt="img" style="zoom:80%;" />

**This goes for the sub-layers of the decoder as well.** 

If we‚Äôre to think of a Transformer of 2 stacked encoders and decoders, it would look something like this:

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_3.png)

## Decoding Component

{{< figure src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/transformer_decoding_1.gif" title="After finishing the encoding phase, we begin the decoding phase. Each step in the decoding phase outputs an element from the output sequence (the English translation sentence in this case)." numbered="true" >}}

- The encoder start by processing the input sequence. 
- The output of the top encoder is then transformed into a set of attention vectors K and V. 
- These are to be used by each decoder in its ‚Äúencoder-decoder attention‚Äù layer which helps the decoder focus on appropriate places in the input sequence

The following steps repeat the process until a special symbol is reached indicating the transformer decoder has completed its output. 	![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/transformer_decoding_2-20200823133024688.gif)

- The output of each step is fed to the bottom decoder in the next time step, 
- The decoders bubble up their decoding results just like the encoders did. 
  - Just like we did with the encoder inputs, we embed and add positional encoding to those decoder inputs to indicate the position of each word.

Note that the self attention layers in the decoder operate in a slightly different way than the one in the encoder: **In the decoder, the self-attention layer is ONLY allowed to attend to earlier positions in the output sequence.**

- This can be done by **masking future positions** (setting them to `-inf`) before the softmax step in the self-attention calculation.

## The Final Linear and Softmax Layer

The final Linear layer + Softmax layer: **Turn a vector of floats (the output of the decoder) into a word**

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/transformer_decoder_output_softmax.png)

- **Linear layer**: a simple fully connected neural network that projects the vector produced by the stack of decoders, into a much, much larger vector called a **logits vector**
  - Let‚Äôs assume that our model knows 10,000 unique English words (our model‚Äôs ‚Äú**output vocabulary**‚Äù) that it‚Äôs learned from its training dataset. This would make the logits vector 10,000 cells wide ‚Äì each cell corresponding to the score of a unique word.
- **Softmax layer**
  - Turns those scores into probabilities (all positive, all add up to 1.0). 
  - The cell with the **highest probability** is chosen, and the word associated with it is produced as the output for this time step.

## Training

### Word Representation

During training, an untrained model would go through the exact same forward pass. Since we are training it on a labeled training dataset, we can compare its output with the actual correct output.

To visualize this, let‚Äôs assume our output vocabulary only contains six words(‚Äúa‚Äù, ‚Äúam‚Äù, ‚Äúi‚Äù, ‚Äúthanks‚Äù, ‚Äústudent‚Äù, and ‚Äú`<eos>`‚Äù (short for ‚Äòend of sentence‚Äô)).

{{< figure src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/t/vocabulary.png" title="The output vocabulary of our model is created in the preprocessing phase before we even begin training." numbered="true" >}}

After defining the output vocabulary, use **One-Hot-encoding** to indicate each word in our vocabulary. E.g., we can indicate the word ‚Äúam‚Äù using the following vector:

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/one-hot-vocabulary-example.png)

### The Loss Function

Say it‚Äôs our **first** step in the training phase, and we‚Äôre training it on a simple example ‚Äì translating ‚Äúmerci‚Äù into ‚Äúthanks‚Äù.

We want the output to be a probability distribution indicating the word ‚Äúthanks‚Äù. But since this model is not yet trained, that‚Äôs unlikely to happen just yet.

{{< figure src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_logits_output_and_label.png" title="Since the model's parameters (weights) are all initialized randomly, the (untrained) model produces a probability distribution with arbitrary values for each cell/word. We can compare it with the actual output, then tweak all the model's weights using backpropagation to make the output closer to the desired output." numbered="true" >}}

Compare two probability distributions: **simply subtract one from the other**. (For more details, look at [cross-entropy](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-Visual-Information/) and [Kullback‚ÄìLeibler divergence](https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2017/5/9/kullback-leibler-divergence-explained).)



Note that the example above is an oversimplified example. 

In practice, we‚Äôll use a sentence longer than one word. For example 

- input: ‚Äúje suis √©tudiant‚Äù and 
- expected output: ‚Äúi am a student‚Äù. 

What this really means, is that we want our model to successively output probability distributions where:

- Each probability distribution is represented by a vector of width vocab_size (6 in our toy example, but more realistically a number like 30,000 or 50,000)

- The first probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word ‚Äúi‚Äù

- The second probability distribution has the highest probability at the cell associated with the word ‚Äúam‚Äù

- And so on, until the fifth output distribution indicates ‚Äò`<end of sentence>`‚Äô symbol, which also has a cell associated with it from the 10,000 element vocabulary.

  {{< figure src="http://jalammar.github.io/images/t/output_target_probability_distributions.png" title="The targeted probability distributions we'll train our model against in the training example for one sample sentence." numbered="true" >}}

After training the model for enough time on a large enough dataset, we would hope the produced probability distributions would look like this:

![img](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/output_trained_model_probability_distributions.png)

Now, because the model produces the outputs one at a time, we can assume that the model is selecting the word with the highest probability from that probability distribution and throwing away the rest (**"greedy decoding"**).
