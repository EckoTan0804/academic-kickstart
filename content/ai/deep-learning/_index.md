Here we'll focus on the **theoretical knowledge** of Deep Learning and Neural Network as well as the mathematics behind.

The content is combination of

- notes of lecture "[Deep Learning and Neural Networks](http://isl.anthropomatik.kit.edu/english/3126_3133.php)" I visited in summer semester 2020 at [KIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlsruhe_Institute_of_Technology)

- my own summary
  - marked with :thumbsup: 
  - trying to explain things as clear as possible
  - referencing a number of great tutorials and blogs
