To keep a language model from assigning zero probability to these unseen events, we‚Äôll have to shave off a bit of probability mass from some more frequent events and give it to the events we‚Äôve never seen.

## Laplace smoothing (Add-1 smoothing)

üí° Idea: add one to all the bigram counts, before we normalize them into probabilities. 

- does not perform well enough to be used in modern n-gram models ü§™, but
- usefully introduces many of the concepts
- gives a useful baseline
- a practical smoothing algorithm for other tasks like text classification

**Unsmoothed** maximum likelihood estimate of the unigram probability of the word $w_i$: its count $c_i$ normalized by the total number of word tokens $N$
$$
P\left(w\_{i}\right)=\frac{c\_{i}}{N}
$$
**Laplace smoothed**: 

- Merely adds one to each count
- Since there are $V$ words in the vocabulary and each one was incremented, we also need to adjust the denominator to take into account the extra $V$ observations.

$$
P_{\text {Laplace}}\left(w_{i}\right)=\frac{c_{i}+1}{N+V}
$$

**Adjust count** $c^*$
$$
c_{i}^{*}=\left(c_{i}+1\right) \frac{N}{N+V}
$$

- easier to compare directly with the MLE counts and can be turned into a probability like an MLE count by normalizing by $N$

  > $\frac{c_I^*}{N} = \left(c_{i}+1\right) \frac{N}{N+V} \cdot \frac{1}{N} =\frac{c_{i}+1}{N+V} = P_{\text {Laplace}}\left(w_{i}\right)$

### Another aspect of smoothing

A related way to view smoothing is as **discounting** (lowering) some non-zero counts in order to get the probability mass that will be assigned to the zero counts. 

Thus, instead of referring to the discounted counts $c^{\*}$, we might describe a smoothing algorithm in terms of a relative **discount** $d_c$ 
$$
d_c = \frac{c^*}{c}
$$
(the ratio of the discounted counts to the original counts)

### Example

- Add-one smoothed counts and probabilities

Computation:

- Recall: normal bigram probabilities are computed by normalizing each row of counts by the unigram count
  $$
  P\left(w_{n} | w_{n-1}\right)=\frac{C\left(w_{n-1} w_{n}\right)}{C\left(w_{n-1}\right)}
  $$

- add-one smoothed bigram:¬†augment the unigram count by the number of total word types in the vocabulary

  $$
  P_{\text {Laplace }}^{*}\left(w_{n} | w_{n-1}\right)=\frac{C\left(w_{n-1} w_{n}\right)+1}{\sum_{w}\left(C\left(w_{n-1} w\right)+1\right)}=\frac{C\left(w_{n-1} w_{n}\right)+1}{C\left(w_{n-1}\right)+V}
  $$

- It is often convenient to reconstruct the count matrix so we can see how much a smoothing algorithm has changed the original counts.
  $$
  c^{*}\left(w_{n-1} w_{n}\right)=\frac{\left[C\left(w_{n-1} w_{n}\right)+1\right] \times C\left(w_{n-1}\right)}{C\left(w_{n-1}\right)+V}
  $$
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-06-03%2017.19.19.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2020-06-03 17.19.19" style="zoom:80%;" />

Add-one smoothing has made a very big change to the counts.

- $C(\text{want to})$ changed from 609 to 238
- $P(to|want)$ decreases from .66 in the unsmoothed case to .26 in the smoothed case
- The discount $d$ (the ratio between new and old counts) shows us how strikingly the counts for each prefix word have been reduced
  - the discount for the bigram *want to* is .39
  - the discount for *Chinese food* is .10

The sharp change in counts and probabilities occurs because too much probability mass is moved to all the zeros.

## Add-k smoothing

Instead of adding 1 to each count, we add a fractional count $k$
$$
P_{\mathrm{Add}-\mathrm{k}}^{*}\left(w_{n} | w_{n-1}\right)=\frac{C\left(w_{n-1} w_{n}\right)+k}{C\left(w_{n-1}\right)+k V}
$$

- $k$: can be chosen by optimizing on a devset (validation set)

Add-k smoothing

- useful for some tasks (including text classification)
- still doesn‚Äôt work well for language modeling, generating counts with poor variances and often inappropriate discounts ü§™

## Backoff and interpolation

Sometimes using less context is a good thing, helping to generalize more for contexts that the model hasn‚Äôt learned much about.

### Backoff

**üí° ‚ÄúBack off‚Äù to a lower-order n-gram if we have zero evidence for a higher-order n-gram**

- If the n-gram we need has zero counts, we approximate it by backing off to the (n-1)-gram. We continue backing off until we reach a history that has some counts.
  - *we use the trigram if the evidence is sufficient, otherwise we use the bigram, otherwise the unigram.*

#### Katz backoff

- Rely on a discounted probability $P^*$ if we‚Äôve seen this n-gram before (i.e., if we have non-zero counts)

  - We have to discount the higher-order n-grams to save some probability mass for the lower order n-grams

    > if the higher-order n-grams aren‚Äôt discounted and we just used the undiscounted MLE probability, then as soon as we replaced an n-gram which has zero probability with a lower-order n-gram, we would be adding probability mass, and the total probability assigned to all possible strings by the language model would be greater than 1!

- Otherwise, we recursively back off to the Katz probability for the shorter-history (n-1)-gram.

$\Rightarrow$ The probability for a backoff n-gram $P_{\text{BO}}$ is	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/image-20200803110631566.png" alt="image-20200803110631566" style="zoom:18%;" />

- $P^*$: discounted probability
- $\alpha$: a function to distribute the discounted probability mass to the lower order n-grams



### Interpolation

üí° Mix the probability estimates from all the n-gram estimators, weighing and combining the trigram, bigram, and unigram counts.

In *simple* **linear** interpolation, we combine different order n-grams by linearly interpolating all the models. I.e., we estimate the trigram probability $P\left(w_{n} | w_{n-2} w_{n-1}\right)$ by mixing together the unigram, bigram, and trigram probabilities, each weighted by a $\lambda$
$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\hat{P}\left(w_{n} | w_{n-2} w_{n-1}\right) = & \lambda_{1} P\left(w_{n} | w_{n-2} w_{n-1}\right) \\\\
&+ \lambda_{2} P\left(w_{n} | w_{n-1}\right) \\\\
&+ \lambda_{3} P\left(w_{n}\right)
\end{array}
$$
s.t.
$$
\sum_{i} \lambda_{i}=1
$$
In a *slightly more sophisticated* version of linear interpolation, each $\lambda$ weight is computed by conditioning on the context. 

- If we have particularly accurate counts for a particular bigram, we assume that the counts of the trigrams based on this bigram will be more trustworthy, so we can make the $Œª$s for those trigrams higher and thus give that trigram more weight in the interpolation.

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
\hat{P}\left(w_{n} | w_{n-2} w_{n-1}\right)=& \lambda_{1}\left(w_{n-2}^{n-1}\right) P\left(w_{n} | w_{n-2} w_{n-1}\right) \\\\
&+\lambda_{2}\left(w_{n-2}^{n-1}\right) P\left(w_{n} | w_{n-1}\right) \\\\
&+\lambda_{3}\left(w_{n-2}^{n-1}\right) P\left(w_{n}\right)
\end{array}
$$

#### How to set $\lambda$s?

Learn from a **held-out** corpus

- Held-out corpus: an additional training corpus that we use to set hyperparameters like these $Œª$ values, by choosing the $Œª$ values that maximize the likelihood of the held-out corpus.
- We fix the n-gram probabilities and then search for the $Œª$ values that give us the highest probability of the held-out set
  - Common method: **EM** algorithm

## Kneser-Ney Smoothing üëç

One of the most commonly used and best performing n-gram smoothing methods üëè

Based on **absolute discounting**

- subtracting a fixed (absolute) discount $d$ from each count.
- üí° Intuition: 
  - since we have good estimates already for the very high counts, a small discount *d* won‚Äôt affect them much
  - It will mainly modify the smaller counts, for which we don‚Äôt necessarily trust the estimate anyway

![Êà™Â±è2020-06-03 22.51.39](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-06-03%2022.51.39-20200803110820400.png)

Except for the held-out counts for 0 and 1, all the other bigram counts in the held-out set could be estimated pretty well by just subtracting 0.75 from the count in the training set! In practice this discount is actually a good one for bigrams with counts 2 through 9.

The equation for interpolated absolute discounting applied to bigrams:
$$
P_{\text {AbsoluteDiscounting }}\left(w_{i} | w_{i-1}\right)=\frac{C\left(w_{i-1} w_{i}\right)-d}{\sum_{v} C\left(w_{i-1} v\right)}+\lambda\left(w_{i-1}\right) P\left(w_{i}\right)
$$

- First term: discounted bigram
  - We could just set all the $d$ values to .75, or we could keep a separate discount value of 0.5 for the bigrams with counts of 1.
- Second term: unigram with an interpolation weight $\lambda$

**Kneser-Ney discounting** augments absolute discounting with a more sophisticated way to handle the lower-order unigram distribution.

Sophisticated means: Instead of $P(w)$ which answers the question ‚ÄúHow likely is $w$?‚Äù, we‚Äôd like to create a unigram model that we might call $P\_{\text{CONTINUATION}}$, which answers the question ‚ÄúHow likely is *w* to appear as a novel continuation?‚Äù

How can we estimate this probability of seeing the word $w$ as a novel continuation, in a new unseen context?

üí° The Kneser-Ney intuition: base our $P\_{\text{CONTINUATION}}$ on the *number of different contexts word* $w$ *has appeared in* (the number of bigram types it completes).

- Every bigram type was a novel continuation the first time it was seen.
- We hypothesize that words that have appeared in more contexts in the past are more likely to appear in some new context as well.

The number of times a word $w$ appears as a novel continuation can be expressed as:
$$
P\_{\mathrm{CONTINUATION}}(w) \propto|\{v: C(v w)>0\}|
$$
To turn this count into a probability, we normalize by the total number of word bigram types:
$$
P\_{\text{CONTINUATION}}(w)=\frac{|\{v: C(v w)>0\}|}{|\{(u^{\prime}, w^{\prime}): Cu^{\prime} w^{\prime})>0\}|}
$$
An equivalent formulation based on a different metaphor is to use the number of word types seen to precede $w$, normalized by the number of words preceding all words,
$$
P\_{\mathrm{CONTINUATION}}(w)=\frac{|\{v: C(v w)>0\}|}{\sum_{w^{\prime}}|\{v: C(v w^{\prime})>0\}|}
$$
The final equation for **Interpolated Kneser-Ney smoothing** for bigrams is:
$$
P_{\mathrm{KN}}\left(w\_{i} | w\_{i-1}\right)=\frac{\max \left(C\left(w\_{i-1} w\_{i}\right)-d, 0\right)}{C\left(w\_{i-1}\right)}+\lambda\left(w\_{i-1}\right) P\_{\mathrm{CONTINUATION}}\left(w\_{i}\right)
$$

- $Œª$: normalizing constant that is used to distribute the probability mass
  $$
  \lambda(w_{i-1})=\frac{d}{\sum_{v} C(w_{i-1} v)}|\{w: C(w_{i-1} w)>0\}|
  $$

  - First term: normalized discount
  - Second term: the number of word types that can follow $w_{i-1}$. or, equivalently, the number of word types that we discounted (i.e., the number of times we applied the normalized discount.)

The general recursive formulation is 
$$
P_{\mathrm{KN}}\left(w_{i} | w_{i-n+1}^{i-1}\right)=\frac{\max \left(c_{K N}\left(w_{i-n+1}^{i}\right)-d, 0\right)}{\sum_{v} c_{K N}\left(w_{i-n+1}^{i-1} v\right)}+\lambda\left(w_{i-n+1}^{i-1}\right) P_{K N}\left(w_{i} | w_{i-n+2}^{i-1}\right)
$$

- $C_{KN}$: depends on whether we are counting the highest-order n-gram being interpolated or one of the lower-order n-grams	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/image-20200803111708917.png" alt="image-20200803111708917" style="zoom:18%;" />

  - $\operatorname{continuationcount}(\cdot)$: the number of unique single word contexts for $\cdot$

At the termination of the recursion, unigrams are interpolated with the uniform distribution
$$
P_{\mathrm{KN}}(w)=\frac{\max \left(c_{K N}(w)-d, 0\right)}{\sum_{w^{\prime}} c_{K N}\left(w^{\prime}\right)}+\lambda(\varepsilon) \frac{1}{V}
$$

- $\varepsilon$: empty string
