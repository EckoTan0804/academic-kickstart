## Introduction

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-05-12%2023.38.49.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2020-05-12 23.38.49" style="zoom:50%;" />

### Definition

**Sentiment analysis / opinion mining**

- Determine opinion, sentiment and subjectivity in text
  - What is the authors opinion about something?
  - What are the pros and cons?
- Important task in natural language processing

### Application

- Automatically maintain review and opinion-aggregation websites
- Web search target towards reviews
  - generate results with variety of opinions
- Improve customer relationship management
  - Automatically analyze customer feedback 
- Predict public attitudes towards brand/politics 
- Ad placement
  - Advertise products near positive text 
- Summarization
- Question-answering

### Challenges

- Deep undetstanding
- Co-reference resolution
- Negation handling
- Different hints in the text

## Tasks of SA

- <u>Polarity classification</u>
  - binary classifier if text, sentence, document is positive or negative
- Agreement detection
  - Do two text agree on their opinion?
- Rating
  - How does the user rate a product (1 to 5 stars)
- Subjectivity detection
  - Is a text or sentence subjective or objective?
- Feature/aspect-based sentiment analysis
  - Opinions express on different features/aspects
- Viewpoints and perspectives

## Polar classification

**Task**: 

- Input: Text (Sentence, Document, Several Documents) (variable length)
- Output: positive or negative opinion
- Sequence classification

**Techniques**:

- [Keyword spotting](#keyword-spotting)
- [Lexical affinity](#lexical-affinity)
- [Statistical methods](#statistical-methods) 
- [concept-based approaches](#concept-based-approaches)

### Keyword spotting

- Classify based on occurrence of unambiguous affect words 
  - E.g.: happy, sad, afraid, bored
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è Problems 
  -  <span style="color:red">affect-negated words</span>
    - E.g.: ‚Äú*today was a happy day‚Äù vs ‚Äútoday wasn‚Äôt a happy day at all*‚Äù
  - <span style="color:red">surface features</span>
    - Often no obvious affect words are present

### Lexical affinity

- Increase the number of considered words
- Assign ‚Äúprobable‚Äù affinity to particular emotions

- Example: *Accident* (75% of indicating a negative affect (car accident))
- Train probabilities from linguistic corpora
- ‚ÄºÔ∏è Problems
  - <span style="color:red">negated sentences</span> (*"I avoided an accident"*)
  
    
  
  - <span style="color:red">Words with different meaning</span> (*"I met my girlfriend by accident"*)
  
  - <span style="color:red">Bias towards training data --> domain-dependent</span>

### Statistical methods

üí° Use **machine-learning algorithm** to train classifier

- Input:
  - Represent input text as [features](#features) vector
    - **Feature selection** important for classification performance
- Classifier:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machines 
  - Maximum-entropy-based classification

#### Features

- Word representation
- Position information
- POS infromation
- Syntax: Tree-based features

##### Feeatures Negation

- Negation should invert the features of the sentence
- Approaches:
  - Attach **NOT** to all words near a negation
  
  However
  
  - Not all negation reverse meaning
    - *‚ÄúNo wonder this is considered one of the best ‚Äú*
  - Negation do often not use a key word
    - *‚Äúit avoids all clicheÃÅs and predictability found in Hollywood movies‚Äù*

##### Topic-oriented features

- Opinion of a sentence depend on topic of the article
- Approach: Replace subject of the article by general term

#### Domain adaptation

- **Meaning depends on the domain**
- Different approaches to transfer knowledge from one domain to another
  -  Search domain-independent features
  - Structural correspondence learning algorithm

#### Unsupervised approaches

- Unsupervised lexicon induction

- Find adjectives using linguistic heuristics 

  - words that co-occur with ‚Äúbut‚Äù
    - *elegant but over-priced*

  * words that co-occur with ‚Äúand‚Äù
    * *clever and informative* 

- Build graph

- Cluster or build binary-partition

- Assign polarity using some seed words

#### Relation identification

- **Sentence relationship**
  - Objective and subjective sentence in a review 
  
    
  
  - No random order
    
    - After subjective sentence most probable also subjective sentence 
    
  - First cluster sentence into objective and subjective
  
    - Use labels of the surrounding sentences
    
  - Then Use **only subjective sentence** to classify polarity of review
  
  - **Order of sentence is important**
    
    - End is more important than beginning
    
      
    
    - Use trajectory of local sentiments
  
- **Dialog structure**
- **Class structure**
- **One-vs.-all multi-class categorization**
- **Model as Metric labeling problem**

####  ‚ÄºÔ∏è Problems of statistical methods

- Need enough text to perform classification
- Good performance on page and paragraph level 
- Problems on sentence or clause level

### Concept-based approaches

- Perform semantic text analysis
  - Resources:
    - Web ontologies
    - Semantic networks
  - try to recognize meaning/features
  - heavily rely on depth and breadth of knowledge base

## Opinion summarization

### **Opinion-oriented extraction**

- Example: *"What is the best about the new iPhone?"*

- Approach

  - Extract product features
    - nouns / frequent nouns 
    - heuristic pruning

  - extract opinions associated with these features 
    - sometimes also extract the opinion holder

### What is opinion summarization?

- Generate summary of large number of opinions 
- Aggregate results of sentiment prediction
- Structured summaries:
  - breakdown by aspects/topics 
  - text or visualization

- Conceptual Framework
  - [aspect-based summarization](#aspect-based)
  - [non-aspect-based summarization](#non-aspect-based-opinion-summarizatio)

### Aspect-based

- üí° **Divide input text into aspect/features/subtopics**

  - *E.g.: Review on iPod*

    - *battery life*

    - *design* 

    - *price*

      

- Show structured details

#### How aspect-based opinion summarization works?

- Framework
- **[aspect/feature identification](#aspectfeature-identification)**
  - find important topics 
- **[sentiment prediction](#sentiment-prediction)**
  - determine the sentiment orientation
  - is the aspect judged positive/negative?

- **[summary generation](#summary-generation)** 
  - present results

#### **Aspect/Feature Identification**

- Find subtopics (In some cases already known)
- Techniques
  - NLP-based approaches using POS-tagging /parse trees
  - Shallow parsing
  - use additional knowledge

#### **Sentiment prediction**

- Predict sentiment for the different aspects
- Learning approach:
  - Learn aspect level ratings using the global rating 
  - Naive Bayes classifier
  - ‚ÄºÔ∏è Problem: label examples is expensive

- Most approaches use **lexicon/rule-based** methods 
  - *e.g. list of positive and negative words* (extend by wordNet)

#### **Summary Generation**

Generate and present the opinion summaries

- Statistical Summary
  - show statistics about opinion on different aspect 
  - directly use sentiment prediction output
  - easy to understand

- Text selection
  - show small pieces of text as the summary
  - show strongest opinion words for every aspect

- Aggregate Ratings
  - Show statistics and text selection

-  Summary with timeline
  - Show opinion trends over a timeline

Example:

![Êà™Â±è2020-09-15 19.05.16](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-09-15%2019.05.16.png)

![Êà™Â±è2020-09-15 18.55.28](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-09-15%2018.55.28.png)

#### Integrated Approaches

- **No clear separation of the different steps**

- Topic Sentiment Mixture Model
  - unsupervised approach
  - sentiment prediction and aspect identification in **one** step 
  - Model: **Probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA)**

#### **Multi-task learning**

- **CNN-based approach**

  - C predefined aspect mappers 

  - Sentiment classfiers

  - shared word embedding layer

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-05-13%2011.42.47.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2020-05-13 11.42.47" style="zoom:50%;" />

- **LSTM with attention**

  - Input: word embedding and aspect embedding
  - Relevant parts of the sentence identified through **attention** mechanism

### **Non-aspect-based opinion summarization**

- **Basic Sentiment Summarization**

  1. Classify each input text separately
  2. Count number of positive and negative opinions

- **Text Summarization**

  - Opinion Integration:
    - Expert opinions: complete, but rarely updated
    - Ordinary opinions: unstructured, but updated more often
    - Combine both by first extracting information from expert opinions 
    - Add information from the ordinary opinions

  - Contrastive Opinion Summarization 
    - Show positive and negative aspects

  - Abstractive Text summarization
