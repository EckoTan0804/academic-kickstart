Logistic regression is an instance of supervised classification in which we know the correct label $y$ (either 0 or 1) for each observation $x$.

The system produces/predicts $\hat{y}$, the estimate for the true $y$. We want to learn parameters ($w$ and $b$) that make $\hat{y}$ for each training observation **as close as possible** to the true $y$. ðŸ’ª

This requires two components:

- **loss function**: also called **cost function**, a metric measures the distance between the system output and the gold output
  - The loss function that is commonly used for logistic regression and also for neural networks is **[cross-entropy loss]({{< relref "cross-entropy.md" >}})**
- **Optimization algorithm** for iteratively updating the weights so as to minimize this loss function
  - Standard algorithm: [**gradient descent**]({{< relref "gradient-descent.md" >}})
