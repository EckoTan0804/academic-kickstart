While standard naive Bayes text classification can work well for sentiment analysis, some small changes are generally employed that improve performance. üí™

## Binary multinomial naive Bayes (binary NB)

First, for sentiment classification and a number of other text classification tasks, whether a word occurs or not seems to matter more than its frequency. 

**Thus it often improves performance to clip the word counts in each document at 1**.

Example:

- The example is worked without add-1 smoothing to make the differences clearer. 
- Note that the results counts need not be 1; the word *great* has a count of 2 even for Binary NB, because it appears in multiple documents (in both positive and negative class).

## Deal with negation

During text normalization, prepend the prefix *NOT_* to every word after a token of logical negation (*n‚Äôt, not, no, never*) until the next punc- tuation mark. 

Example:

## Deal with insufficient labeled training data

Derive the positive and negative word features from sentiment lexicons, lists of words that are pre-annotated with positive or negative sentiment.

Popular lexicons:

- General Inquirer
- LIWC
- opinion lexicon
- MPQA Subjectivity Lexicon
