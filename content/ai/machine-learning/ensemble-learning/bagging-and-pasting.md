## TL;DR

- Bootstrap Aggregating (Boosting): Sampling **with** replacement

    ![Boostrap_Aggregating](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Boostrap_Aggregating.png)

- Pasting: Sampling **without** replacement



## Explaination

Ensemble methods work best when the predictors are as independent from one another as possible. 

One way to get a diverse set of classifiers: **use the same training algorithm for every predictor, but to train them on different random subsets of the training set**

- Sampling  **with** replacement: **boostrap aggregating (Bagging)**
- Sampling  **without** replacement: **pasting**


Once all predictors are trained, the ensemble can make a prediction for a new instance by simply aggregating the predictions of all predictors. The aggregation function is typically the **statistical mode** 
- classification: the most frequent prediction (just like a hard voting classifier)
- regression: average

Each individual predictor has a higher bias than if it were trained on the original training set, but aggregation reduces both bias and variance. üëè

Generally, the net result is that the ensemble has a **similar bias but a lower variance** than a single predictor trained on the original training set. 


##Advantages of Bagging and Pasting

- Predictors can all be trained in parallel, via different CPU cores or even different servers. 
- Predictions can be made in parallel. 

 -> They scale very well üëç 

## Bagging vs. Pasting

- Bootstrapping     introduces a bit more diversity in the subsets that each predictor is     trained on, so bagging ends up with a **slightly** **higher bias** than pasting, but this also means that predictors end up being **less correlated** so the ensemble‚Äôs variance is reduced. 

- **Overall, bagging often results in better models**

- However, if you have spare time and CPU power you can use cross- validation to evaluate both bagging and pasting and select the one that works best. 

## Out-of-Bag Evaluation

With bagging, some instances may be sampled several times for any given predictor, while others may not be sampled at all. This means that only about 63% of the training instances are sampled on average for each predictor.

The remaining 37% of the training instances that are not sampled are called **out-of-bag (oob) instances.** Note that they are **not the same 37%** for all predictors. 

Since a predictor never sees the oob instances during training, it can be evaluated on these instances, without the need for a separate validation set. You can evaluate the ensemble itself by averaging out the oob evaluations of each predictor.
