- Different color spaces and classifiers can be used
  - Models: histograms, Gaussian Models, Mixture of Gaussians Model 
  - Histogram-backprojection / Histogram matching

  - Bayes classifier

  - Discriminative Classifiers (ANN, SVM)

- Bayesian classifier and ANN seem to work well
  - Sufficient training data is needed for modeling the pdf, in particular for Bayesian approach (positive & negative pdfs learned)

- Advantages: Fast, rotation & scale invariant, robust against occlusions

- Disadvantages:
  - Affected by illumination

## Color-based face detection overview

üí°Idea: human skin has consistent color, which is distinct from many objects

![Êà™Â±è2020-11-10 14.57.37](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-11-10%2014.57.37.png)

Possible approach:
1. find skin colored pixels
2. Groupskincoloredpixels
- (and apply some heuristics) to find the face

## Color

- **Grayscale** Image: Each pixel represented by **one** number (typically integer between 0 and 255)
- **Color** image: Pixels represented by **three** numbers

Different representations exist --> ‚ÄûColor Spaces‚Äú

### Color spaces

- **RGB**

  - most widely used

  - specifies colors in terms of the primary colors **red (R), green (G), and blue (B)**

    ![Êà™Â±è2020-11-10 15.00.08](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-11-10%2015.00.08-20201110184617048.png)

- **HSV/HSI**: **hue (H)**, **saturation (S)** and **value(V)/intensity (I)**

  - Closely related to human perception (hue, colorfulness and brightness)

    ![Êà™Â±è2020-11-10 17.27.38](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-11-10%2017.27.38.png)

    - Hue: "color"
    - Saturation: How "pure" the color is?
    - Value: "lightness"

- **Class Y spaces**: YCbCr (Digital Video), YIQ (NTSC), YUV (PAL)

  - Y channel contains brightness, other two channels store chrominance (U=B-Y, V=R-Y)

  - Conversion from RGB to Yxx is a linear transformation

    ![Êà™Â±è2020-11-10 18.18.27](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-11-10%2018.18.27.png)

- **Perceptually uniform spaces**

  - Perceived color difference is uniform to difference in color values
  - Euclidian distance can be used for color comparison

  ![Êà™Â±è2020-11-10 18.19.07](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-11-10%2018.19.07.png)

- **Chromatic Color Spaces**

  - Two color channels containing chrominance (colour) information

    - HS (taken from HSV) 
    - UV (taken from YUV)

  - Normalized rg from RGB: 

    - r = R / (R+G+B)

    - g = G / (R+G+B) 
    - b = B / (R+G+B)

  - Sometimes it is argued that chromatic skin color models are more robust

#### Problems

- Reflected color depends on spectrum of the light source (and properties of the object / surface)
- If the light source / illumination changes, the reflected color signal changes!!! ü§™

## How to model skin color?

- Non-parametric models: typically histograms

- Parametric models 
  - Gaussian Model
  - Gaussian Mixture Model

- Or just learn decision boundaries between classes (discriminative model)
  - ANN, SVM, ...

### Histogram as skin color model

![Êà™Â±è2020-11-10 18.34.57](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-11-10%2018.34.57.png)

- üëç Advantages: Works very well in practice
- üëé Disadvantages
  - Memory size quickly gets high
  - A large number of labelled skin and non-skin samples is needed!

#### Histogram Backprojection

- The simplest (and fastest) way to utilize histogram information
- Each pixel in the backprojection is set to the value of the (skin-color) histogram bin indexed by the color of the respective pixel
  - A color $x$ is considered as skin color if $H\_{+}(x) > \theta$

#### Histogram Matching

- Backprojection 
  - is good, when the color distribution of the target is monomodal.
  - is not optimal, when the target is multi colored! :cry:
- üîß Solution: Build a histogram of the image within the search window, and compare it to the target histogram.
  - distance metrics for histograms, e.g.:
    - Battacharya distance

    - Histogram intersection

    - Earth-movers distance,...

#### Histogram Backprojection vs. Matching

- Histogram Backprojection
  - Compares color of a single pixel with color model 
  - Fast and simple

  - Can only cope well with mono-modal distributions 
  - sufficient for skin-color classification

- Histogram Matching / Intersection
  - Compares color histogram of image patch with color model 
  - Better performance

  - Can cope with multi-modal distributions
  - Computationally expensive



### Parametric models 

#### Gaussian Density Models

- Gaussian Densities

  - Assume that the distribution of skin colors p(x) has a parametric functional form

  - Most common function: Gaussion function $\mathrm{G}(\mathbf{x} ; \mu, \mathbf{C})$
    $$
    p(x | \text{skin})=G(x ; \mu, C)=\frac{1}{(2 \pi)^{d / 2}|C|^{1 / 2} }\exp \left\\{-1 / 2(x-\mu)^{\top} C^{-1}(x-\mu)\right\\}
    $$

    - Mean $\mu$ and covariance matrix $C$ are estimated from a training set of skin colors $S = {x\_1,x\_2,...,x\_N}$:
      - $\mu = E\{x\}$
      - $C = E\{(\boldsymbol{x}-\mu)^T(\boldsymbol{x}-\mu)\}$

  - A color is considered as skin color if

    - $p(x|\text{skin}) > \theta$
    - $p(x|\text{skin}) > p(x|\text{non-skin})$

#### Mixture of Gaussian Models

$$
p(x)=\sum\_{i=1}^{K} \pi\_{i} G\left(x, \mu\_{i}, C\_{i}\right)
$$

- Parameter set $\Phi$ can be estimated using the **EM** algorithm

  - Iteratively changes parameters so as to maximize the log-likelihood of the training set:
    $$
    L=\log \prod\_{i=1}^{N} p\left(x\_{i} \mid \Phi\right)
    $$

- A color is considered as skin color if
  - $p(x|\text{skin}) > \theta$
  - $p(x|\text{skin}) > p(x|\text{non-skin})$

#### Bayes Classifier

- Skin Classification using **Bayes Decision Rule**

  - Minimum cost decision rule

  - Classify pixel to skin class if $P(\text{Skin} | x)>P(\text{Non-Skin} | x)$

  - Decision Rule:
    $$
    \frac{p(\mathbf{x} \mid \text {Skin})}{p(\mathbf{x} \mid \text {Non-Skin})} \geq \frac{P(\text {Non-Skin})}{P(\text {Skin})}
    $$

  - The classconditionals $p(x|\omega)$ can be estimated from the corresponding histograms:
    $$
    p\left(x \mid \omega\_{i}\right)=h\_{i}(x) / \sum\_{x} h\_{i}(x)
    $$

    - $h\_i(x)$: count of pixels from class $\omega\_{i}$ that have value $x$

- Support Vector Machine



## Performance Measures

### For classification

When comparing recognition hypotheses with ground-truth annotations have to consider four cases:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/confusion-matrix.png" alt="Measuring Performance: The Confusion Matrix ‚Äì Glass Box" style="zoom: 40%;" />

> More see: [Evaluation]({{< relref "../../machine-learning/ml-fundamentals/evaluation.md" >}})

#### ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic)

- Used for the task of classification
- Measures the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate

$$
\begin{array}{l}
\text { true positive rate }=\frac{\mathrm{TP}}{\mathrm{Pos}}=\frac{\mathrm{TP}}{\mathrm{TP}+\mathrm{FN}} \\\\
\text { false positive rate }=\frac{\mathrm{FP}}{\mathrm{Neg}}=\frac{\mathrm{FP}}{\mathrm{FP}+\mathrm{TN}}
\end{array}
$$

- Each prediction hypothesis has generally an associated probability value or score

- The performance values can therefore plotted into a graph for each possible score as a threshold

- Example:

  ![Êà™Â±è2020-11-12 23.27.18](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-11-12%2023.27.18.png)

### Skin-color: Analysis and Comparison

Conclusions

- Bayesian approach and MLP worked best
  - Bayesian approach needs much more memory

- Approach is largely unaffected by choice of color space, but

- Results degraded when only chrominance channels were used

## From Skin-Colored Pixels to Faces

- Skin-colored pixels need to be grouped into object representations

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-11-13%2014.56.21.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2020-11-13 14.56.21" style="zoom:80%;" />

- üî¥ Problems: 
  - skin-colored background, 
  - further skin-colored body parts (hands, arms, ...), 
  - Noise, ...

### Perceptual Grouping

- **Morphological Operators**: Operators performing an action on shapes where the input and output is a binary image.

- Threshold each pixel‚Äòs skin affiliation --> Binary Image

- **Morphological Erosion**

  - *Remove* pixels from edges of objects

  - Set pixel value to **min** value of surrounding pixels

    ![Êà™Â±è2020-11-13 15.00.53](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-11-13%2015.00.53.png)

- **Morphological Dilatation**

  - *Add* pixels to edges of objects

  - Set pixel value to **max** value of surrounding pixels

    ![Êà™Â±è2020-11-13 15.41.11](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-11-13%2015.41.11.png)

- **Morphological Opening**

  - Apply erosion, then dilatation

    ![Êà™Â±è2020-11-13 15.42.38](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-11-13%2015.42.38.png)

  - Goal:

    - Smooth outline
    - Open small bridges 
    - Eliminate outliers

- **Morphological Closing**

  - Apply dilatation, then erosion

    ![Êà™Â±è2020-11-13 15.45.25](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-11-13%2015.45.25.png)

  - Goal:

    - Smooth inner edges 
    - Connect small distances 
    - Fill unwanted holes

- Apply morphological closing then morphological opening

  - Resulting image is reduced to connected regions of skin color (blobs)

    ![Êà™Â±è2020-11-13 15.59.57](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-11-13%2015.59.57.png)

### From Skin Blobs To Faces

- Goal: align bounding box around face candidate

  ![Êà™Â±è2020-11-13 16.01.23](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2020-11-13%2016.01.23.png)

- Important for:

  - Face Recognition

  - Head Pose Estimation

- Different approaches:

  - Choose cluster with biggest size

  - Ellipse fitting (approximate face region by ellipse)

  - Heuristics to distinguish between different skin clusters

  - Use temporal information (tracking) 
  - Facial Feature Detection
