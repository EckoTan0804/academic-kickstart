## Preliminaries

- Review and renew your literature search
- Determine who your **audience** is
  - What kind of paper is it? Research, review, tutorial?
  - What journal is it intended for?
  - Undergraduates, researchers, but always the reviewers!

 ## The "Algorithm" 

**💡 Just get started. Do NOT procrastinate! 💪**

### First draft

Writing the initial draft is the creative part of the job. Your job now is to produce a **complete** first draft, NOT a perfect first draft. Editing is a second stage of the work. It is the critical thinking, analytical part of the job. Editing before you've completed your first draft is a waste of time!

**So just write, don't stop and edit!** 

1. Create an **outline** and always work from it
   - If you have to stop, you can easily pick up the writing later.
   - How?
     - Make a list of your figures and tables
     - Put them in order of presenation, arrange them in some logical sequence, as they may appear in the results and discussion

2. Begin with the **Experimental** section
   - The easiest part to write, because this is the part you're most familiar with (You've done the experiment, you know how is it done)
   - Getting it done will give you a feeling of progress

3. Write the **Results** and **Discussion**, following the outline (list of figures and tables)

### Critical editting

4. The critical part is when you convert that into concise and coherent English and make sure that the science that you've written is correct.

### Complete the paper

5. Write the **Conclusions** (in a numbered format)

6. Write the **Abstracts** and **Acknowledgements**

7. Write the **Introduction** (the hardest part of the paper)
   - Why was the study done? what is its purpose?
   - You need to collect the relenant essential background information and put that together in the introduction. You need to give the readers a sufficient background to understand what you did
