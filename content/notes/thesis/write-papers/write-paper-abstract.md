## Function

- **Summaries the major aspects of the entire paper in one paragraph**

  - The **question(s) you investigated** (or **purpose**) (from introduction)
    - State the purpose very clearly in the first or second sentence.
  - The **experimental design** and **methods** used (from Methods)
    - Clearly express the basic design of the study.
    - Name or briefly describe the basic methodology used without going into excessive detail. Be sure to indicate the key techniques used.
  - The **major findings** including **key quantitative results**, or **trends** (from Results)
    - Report those results which answer the questions you were asking
    - Identify trends, relative change or differences, etc.
  - A brief summary of your **interpetations** and **conclusions** (from Discussion)
    - Clearly state the implications of the answers your results gave you.

- Length: **200-300** words maximum

- Try to limit your statements concerning each segment of the paper (i.e. purpose, methods, results, etc.) to **two or three** sentences

- Abstract is extremly important!

  - It helps readers decide whether they want to read the rest of the paper
  - It may be the only part they can obtain via electronic literature searches or in published abstracts.

  $\rightarrow$ Enough key information (e.g., summary results, observations, trends, etc.) must be included!

## How do you know when you have enough information in your Abstract?

Imagine that you are another researcher doing an study similar to the one you are reporting. If your Abstract was the only part of the paper you could access, would you be happy with the information presented there?

## Style

- Use the active voice when possible, but much of it may require passive constructions.
- Write your Abstract using concise, but complete, sentences, and get to the point quickly.
- **Use past tense.**
- **Maximum length should be 200-300 words, usually in a single paragraph.**
- ‚ùå Should NOT contain
  - lengthy background information,
  - references to other literature,
  - elliptical (i.e., ending with ...) or incomplete sentences,
  - abbreviations or terms that may be confusing to readers,
  - any sort of illustration, figure, or table, or references to them.

## Strategy

üí° Must be written **last** since it will summarize the paper

1. Take whole sentences or key phrases from each section and put them in a sequence which summarizes the paper.
2. Set about revising or adding words to make it all cohesive and clear.
3. Double check
   - Check to make sure that the information in the abstract completely agrees with what is written in the paper. 
   - Confirm that all the information appearing the abstract actually appears in the body of the paper.
