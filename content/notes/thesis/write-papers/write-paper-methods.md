ðŸŽ¯ Explain clearly how you carried out your study

- **Describe your experimental design clearly**
- **Describe the procedures for your study in sufficient detail that other scientists could repeat your work to verify your findings**

- **Describe how the data were summarized and analyzed**

## Style

The style in this section should read as if you were verbally describing the conduct of the experiment.

- Requires more use of **third person, passive** constructions than other sections
- Use the **past tense** throughout
- Avoid use of the first person
