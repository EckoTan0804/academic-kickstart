**Do NOT read article from beginning to end!!!**

## Phase 1: Surveying the article 

Feel free to stop reading the article at any point

- Read the **title and keywords** (these are probably what got you look at the paper)
  - If these don't interest you at all ➡️ stop!
- Read the **abstract** (most important part of the paper)
- Read the **conclusions**

## Phase 2: Reading the article

- Look at the **tables and figures** (including captions)
  - This is really what was done in the work
  - It will help you decide, whether you want to dig in or not
- Read the **introduction**
  - This is the background needed and why the study was done.
- Read the **results and discussion**
  - This is the real heart of the paper. Here you will gonna spend most of the time

- Read the **experimental**
  - This is how they did the work
  - You only get to this point if you are really interested and need to understand exactly what was done to better understand the meaning of the data and its interpretation.

## Phase 3: Write some **notes** so you don't have to re-read the whole paper again

The faintest writing is better than the best memory! 好记性不如烂笔头！
