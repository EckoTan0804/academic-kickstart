## Passing multiple arguments to a function

`*args` and `**kwargs` allow you to pass multiple arguments or keyword arguments to a function. 

For example, we neede to take a **various** numbers of arguments and compute their sum.


The first way is often the most intuitive for people that have experience with collections: simply pass a `list` or a `set` of all the arguments to your function.


```python
def my_sum(my_integers):
    result = 0
    for x in my_integers:
        result += x
    return result

list_of_integers = [1, 2, 3]
my_sum(list_of_integers)
```

This implementation works, but whenever you call this function youâ€™ll also need to create a list of arguments to pass to it. This can be inconvenient, especially if you donâ€™t know up front all the values that should go into the list. ðŸ¤ª

This is where `*args` can be really useful, because it allows you to pass a varying number of positional arguments.


```python
def my_sum(*args):
    result = 0
    # Iterating over the python `args` tuple
    for x in args:
        result += x
    return result

# *args = 1, 2, 3
# -> args = (1, 2, 3)
my_sum(1, 2, 3)
```

```python
def print_args(*args):
    print(args)
    
print_args(1, 2, 3)
```

    (1, 2, 3)


In this example, weâ€™re no longer passing a list to `my_sum()`. Instead, weâ€™re passing three different positional arguments. **`my_sum()` takes all the parameters that are provided in the input and packs them all into a single iterable object named `args`.**

The magic is that we use the **unpacking operator** (`*`).  The iterable object youâ€™ll get using the unpacking operator `*` is not a `list` but a `tuple`, which is NOT mutable.

## Using the Python kwargs Variable in Function Definitions

`**kwargs` works just like `*args`, but instead of accepting positional arguments it accepts keyword (or **named**) arguments. 

E.g.:


```python
def concatenate(**kwargs):
    result = ""
    # Iterating over the Python kwargs dictionary
    for arg in kwargs.values():
        result += arg
    return result

print(concatenate(a="Real", b="Python", 
                  c="Is", d="Great", e="!"))
```

    RealPythonIsGreat!


Like `args`, `kwargs` is just a name that can be changed to whatever you want. Again, what is important here is the use of the **unpacking operator** (`**`).

Note:  If we [iterate over the dictionary](https://realpython.com/iterate-through-dictionary-python/) and want to return its **values**, we must use `.values()`. Otherwise it will iterates over the **keys** of the kwargs dictionary.

## Ordering Arguments in a Function

The correct order for parameters is:

1. Standard arguments
2. `*args` arguments
3. `**kwargs` arguments

E.g.: 


```python
# correct
def my_function(a, b, *args, **kwargs):
    pass
```

## Unpacking With the Asterisk Operators: * & **

In short, the unpacking operators are operators that unpack the values from iterable objects in Python. The single asterisk operator `*` can be used on any iterable that Python provides, while the double asterisk operator `**` can only be used on dictionaries.

### `*`

The `*` operator works on any iterable object.

For example:


```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
print(my_list)
```

    [1, 2, 3]


THe list is printed, **along with the corresponding brackets and commas**.

Now try to prepend the unpacking operator `*` to the name of the list: 


```python
print(*my_list)
```

    1 2 3


Here, the * operator tells print() to unpack the list first.

In this case, the output is no longer the list itself, but rather the content of the list. The difference is: Instead of a list, `print()` has taken three separate arguments as the input.

Another thing should be noticed is that we used the unpacking operator `*` to call a function, instead of in a function definition. In this case, `print()` takes all the items of a list as though they were single arguments.

#### Other convenient uses of the unpacking operator

##### E.g. 1

Split a list into three different parts: The output should show the first value, the last value, and all the values in between. 

With the unpacking operator, we can do this in just one line of code:


```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

a, *b, c = my_list

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
```

    1
    [2, 3, 4, 5]
    6


##### E.g. 2

Merge two lists:


```python
list_1 = [1, 2, 3]
list_2 = [4, 5, 6]

merged_list = [*list_1, *list_2]
merged_list
```




    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]



#### For strings

In Python, strings are iterable objects. So the `*` operators can also be used to unpack a string.

E.g.:


```python
a = [*'HelloWorld']
a
```




    ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd']



The previous example seems great, but when you work with these operators itâ€™s important to keep in mind the seventh rule of [*The Zen of Python*](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) by Tim Peters: *Readability counts*!

Consider the following example:


```python
*a, = 'HelloWorld'
a
```




    ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd']



Thereâ€™s the unpacking operator `*`, followed by a variable, a comma, and an assignment. Thatâ€™s a lot packed into one line! In fact, this code is no different from the previous example. It just takes the string `HelloWorld` and assigns all the items to the new list `a`, thanks to the unpacking operator `*`.

**The comma after the `a` does the trick. When you use the unpacking operator with variable assignment, Python requires that your resulting variable is either a list or a tuple. With the trailing comma, you have actually defined a tuple with just one named variable `a`.**

While this is a neat trick, many Pythonistas would not consider this code to be very readable. **As such, itâ€™s best to use these kinds of constructions sparingly.**


### `**`

The `**` operator works similarly as `*`, but only for dictionary.


```python
my_first_dict = {"A": 1, "B": 2}
my_second_dict = {"C": 3, "D": 4}

my_merged_dict = {**my_first_dict, **my_second_dict}
my_merged_dict
```




    {'A': 1, 'B': 2, 'C': 3, 'D': 4}
