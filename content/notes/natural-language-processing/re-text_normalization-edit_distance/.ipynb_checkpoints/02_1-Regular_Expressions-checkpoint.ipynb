    "## Basic RE Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Case sensitive**\n",
    "  - `/s/` is distinct from `/S/`\n",
    "  - `/woodchucks/` will NOT match the string `/Woodchucks/`\n",

    "- **Disjunction** of characters: `[]`\n",

    "- **Zero or more**: `*` (the Kleene \\*)\n",

    "    - `/a*/` means “any string of zero or more *a*s”\n",
    "      - Will match *a* or *aaaaaa*\n",
    "      - Also match *Off Minor* (since the string *Off Minor* has zero *a*’s)\n",

    "- Parenthesis operator: `(` and `)`\n",
    "  - Make the disjunction operator apply only to a specific pattern\n",

    "- Greedy and non-greedy matching\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose we wanted to do this without the use of `/\\b/` since `/\\b/` won’t treat underscores and numbers as word boundaries; but we might want to find *the* in some context where it might also have underlines or numbers nearby (*the_* or *the25*). We need to specify that we want instances in which there are no alphabetic letters on either side of the *the*: `/[ˆa-zA-Z][tT]he[ˆa-zA-Z]/`\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span style=\"color:red\">Problem: it won’t find the word *the* when it begins a line.</span>\n",
