## Baiscs

Internet: network of networks

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-04%2013.02.45.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-04 13.02.45" style="zoom:67%;" />



### High-level View on an IP Router

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-04%2013.03.49.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-04 13.03.49" style="zoom: 67%;" />

- **Control Plane**
  - Routing protocols

  - Exchange of routing messages for calculation of routes

- **Data Plane**
  - Lookup

  - Forwarding of packets at layer 3

- **Routing table**
  - Generated by routing protocol
  - Entries: Mapping of destination IP prefixes to next hop (IP address)
  - Optimized for the particular routing algorithm
  - Performance is not critical 
    - Implemented in software

- **Forwarding table**
  - Used for packet forwarding
  - Entries: Mapping of IP prefixes to outgoing ports (interface ID and MAC address)
  - Optimized for longest prefix matching
  - Performance is critical (lookup in line speed)!
    - Partially uses dedicated hardware

- **Routing metric** (also named **cost**, **weight**)
  - Metric used by a router to make routing decision

  - Can be applied to an individual link or to the overall path
  - *Examples*
    - *Utilization, latency, data rate* 
    - *Number of hops*

- **Routing policy**
  - Policy-based routing decisions
  - Policies are defined by network operator / owner

### Distributed Adaptive Routing

- Currently most commonly used in the Internet
- An instance of the routing protocol **in each router** 
  - Exchange of routing information via routing messages
- Adaptation of the paths to the current situation in the network

![Êà™Â±è2021-03-04 14.29.56](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-04%2014.29.56.png)

### Path computation

Network is modeled as **graph**
$$
G = (N, E)
$$

- $N$: nodes (routers)
- $E$: edges
  - Links between routers are edges 
  - Edges are associated with metric

Example

![Êà™Â±è2021-03-04 14.31.28](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-04%2014.31.28.png)



##Autonomous Systems

### Structuring into autonomous systems

Internet routing can be divided into **Autonomous Systems (AS)**

- Routing **inside** an autonomous system using **Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)**
- Routing between autonomous systems using **Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-04%2014.42.27.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-04 14.42.27" style="zoom: 67%;" />

#### Autonomous Systems

- Identification: Unique number called **Autonomous Systems Number (ASN)**
  - earlier 16 bit; now 32 bit
- Properties
  - Appears as a single entity to the outside
  - Uniform routing policy
  - Typically uniform interior routing protocol
    - Different ASes can use different interior routing protocols
- üëç Advantages
  - Separated administrative domains
  - Scalability by using two logical levels
    - Routing protocol inside an AS (not global) 
    - Routing protocol between ASes

- **Important Properties**
  - Scalability of routing protocols
    - Overhead increases with size of the network üìà
      - Space for storing routing information
      - Number of routing messages to exchange 
      - Computation overhead
  - Operator autonomy
    - Choice of interior routing protocol 
    - Hiding of internal network structure

- Allocation
  - IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) delegates allocation to **Regional Internet Registries (RIR)**, e.g.,
    - ARIN (North America)

    - RIPE NCC (Europe, Middle East and Central Asia) APNIC (Asia-Pacific)

    - LACNIC (Latin America, Caribbean)

    - AfriNIC (Africa)

#### Subdivision into ASs

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-04%2014.53.42.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-04 14.53.42" style="zoom: 67%;" />

#### Classification of ASes

- Classification based on **role**
  - **Stub AS**
    - Small organizations and enterprises (Mostly operate only regionally) 
    - Connected to exactly one provider
    - No transit traffic
  - **Multihomed AS**
    - Large enterprises

    - Connected to several providers (reliability) 
    - No transit traffic
  - **Transit AS**
    - Provider (Often global scope)

- Classification based on **‚Äúeconomic position/influence‚Äù**

  - Tier 1, tier 2, tier 3 ...

  ![Êà™Â±è2021-03-04 14.57.26](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-04%2014.57.26.png)

#### Different Roles

- **End customer**
  - Uses Internet application
  - Examples
    - Universities
    - Enterprises
    - Customers of Internet Service Providers (ISP)
- [**Content delivery provider**](#content-delivery-provider)
  - Requested by end customers / Internet application 
    - Provide content
  - Examples: Google, Akamai, Yahoo, YouTube, Facebook...

### Reachability across autonomous systems

#### Reachability

Main problem

- How to ensure mutual reachability? 
- Cooperation among autonomous systems?

Basic concepts

- [**Transit**](#connectivity-and-transit): Purchased connectivity üí∏
- [**Peering**](#peering): Direct connection, typically between ASes of the same tier

#### Connectivity and Transit

- Establish connectivity
  - Establish paths to all other ASes in the Internet

  - AS operator purchases connectivity from one or more ASes

- **Transit**

  > **Internet transit** is the service of allowing network traffic to cross or "transit" a computer network, usually used to connect a smaller [Internet service provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider) (ISP) to the larger [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_transit))

  - Purchased connectivity üí∏
    - Upstream: provider (seller) of transit 
    - Downstream: customer (buyer)
  - Traffic exchange
    - In both directions

    - **Only downstream AS must pay**; usually volume rate

  - Transit AS: Provider AS that offers transit

- Options for connecting a stub AS

  - Stub AS

    ![Êà™Â±è2021-03-04 15.23.16](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-04%2015.23.16.png)

  - Dualhomed stub AS

    ![Êà™Â±è2021-03-04 15.23.52](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-04%2015.23.52.png)

  - Multihomed stub AS

    ![Êà™Â±è2021-03-04 15.24.16](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-04%2015.24.16.png)

#### Peering

- **Private peering**

  - Direct connection between two ASes, usually of same tier

  - No cost for traffic exchange; costs for network infrastructure apply

  - However

    - Mostly **only data traffic between privately peered ASes** 
    - NO transit traffic of other ASes

  - Video explanation

    {{< youtube T2jb1tzXzMw>}}

  - Example: peering and transit combination

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-04%2015.34.37.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-04 15.34.37" style="zoom:80%;" />

  - üëç Advantages
    - Benefits both ASes: save transit costs, that otherwise would apply 
    - Shorter data paths: fewer AS hops between source and destination
  - üî¥ Problems
    - Direct connection of ASes complicated (Different geographical locations)
    - Full mesh of $n$ ASes ($\frac{(n-1)n}{2}$ separate connections!)

- **Public peering**

  - Through **Internet exchange points (IXPs)**

    - Central public authority for interconnection

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-04%2015.59.13.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-04 15.59.13" style="zoom:67%;" />
    - Neutral traffic forwarding on layer 2
    - No differentiation regardless of customer, content, or type of service
    - Examples
      - DECIX (the world‚Äôs biggest IXP)

  - Members / customers: Monthly fixed charges per network port
    - Necessary for operation and maintenance of IXP‚Äòs switching platform

  - Different peering policies
    - **Open**: AS is open for peering with all other ASes
    - **Selective**: Peering only under given terms and conditions
    - **Restrictive**: AS does not engage in new peering relationships
    - **No Peering**: AS does not do any peering

#### Autonomous Systems and Transit/Peering

- **Tier 1**
  - Large global ASes with access to (all) other ASes
    - Do not buy any transit. Sell transit
    - Peering with other tier 1 ASes
  - *Examples: Deutsche Telekom, AT&T...*
- **Tier 2**
  - Big national and inter-regional ASes
    - Connection to providers of Internet applications
  - Downstream of tier 1 ASes
    - Sell transit to other ASes 
    - Usually employ peering
  - *Examples: Vodafone, Comcast, Tele2*

- **Tier 3**
  - Small mostly regional ASes
    - Connections with small providers of Internet applications
  - Downstream of tier 2 providers
    - Usually do not sell transit to other ASes 
    - Sell transit mostly to end customers/users 
    - Usually employ peering
  - *Examples: KabelBW, NETHINKS, Alice*

#### Content Delivery Provider

- **üéØ Goal: FAST delivery of content (i.e. low latencies)**

  $\rightarrow$ Locations close to tier 1 peering points are preferred

- Two basic alternatives
  - Web servers are hosted **directly in tier 1 ASes** (Does not require an own AS number)
  - Web servers are connected over own routers
    - [**Content delivery network (CDN)**](#content-delivery-network)
    - Own AS number required

    - Peering with essential providers at important peering points 
    - *Examples: Google, Yahoo, Akamai*

#### Content Delivery Network

- World wide network with own AS number

  - Thousands of **Points of Presence (PoP)** spread across the world

- Point of Presence

  - Consists of access routers und core routers 
    - Access router at the edge of a CDN

    - Core router inside a CDN

  - Customers are connecting through access routers

- Objectives
  - Load balancing at access routers
  - Be close to customers $\rightarrow$ low latencies

### Routing in and between Autonomous Systems

Classification

- **Interior gateway protocols (IGPs)** *INSIDE* one AS
  - A.k.a **intra-domain routing protocols**
  - Are encapsulated inside an AS, i.e., not visible to the outside 
  - Different IGPs in different ASes possible

  - Metric-based
- **Exterior gateway protocols (EGPs)** *BETWEEN* ASes 
  - Also named **inter-domain routing protocols**

  - Single protocol between *all* ASes

  - Policy-based

![Êà™Â±è2021-03-04 16.48.23](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-04%2016.48.23.png)

## RIP: Routing Information Protocol 

- **Interior** gateway protocol
- Very simple protocol that requires very little configuration

### RIP in the Protocol Stack

- Application process routed implements RIP and manages forwarding table
- RIP routing messages are sent over UDP $\rightarrow$ NOT reliable

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-04%2023.16.57.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-04 23.16.57" style="zoom:80%;" />

### Routing Metric

- **Distance between source and destination = number of hops on the path (hop count)**

- Hop count

  - Refer to the number of intermediate devices through which data must pass between source and destination.

    - Each time that a packet of data moves from one router (or device) to another, that is considered one HOP.

    {{< figure src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Hop-count-trans-20210304235011333.png" caption="An illustration of hops in a wired network. The hop count between the computers in this case is 2." numbered="true" >}}

  - Limited range of values: 1 - 15 

  - Value of 16 corresponds to "infinity"

### RIP Routing Messages

- RIP protocol entities exchange routing messages 
  - UDP is used as transport protocol
- Types of routing messages
  - **Request** message
    - Requires complete routing table or part of it
  - **Response** message for different reasons
    - Response to specific query
    - Regular update
    - Triggered update

### Routing Updates

#### Outgoing

- Regular routing update
  - Periodically, every 30 seconds
  - Sends entire routing table to all its neighbors
  - Entries in the routing table are periodically refreshed
  - No refresh for at least 180 seconds? $\rightarrow$ Hop-Count is set to 16 (‚Äûinfinite‚Äú), corresponding route is invalidated
- Metric for route changes (*triggered* update)
  - Only changes since the last update are communicated, not the complete routing table
  - Rate limitation in order to reduce load on the network

#### Incoming

- Entry for a destination address does not exist in routing table and received metric is not ‚Äûinfinite‚Äú $\rightarrow$ **Insert** new entry in routing table

- Current entry for a destination address in routing table has larger metric **or** routing update was sent by the ‚Äúnext router‚Äù for this destination $\rightarrow$ **Modify** entry

- Otherwise $\rightarrow$ **Ignore** routing update

#### Example

Scenario

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-04%2023.42.49.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-04 23.42.49" style="zoom:80%;" />

- Connecting lines represent either direct links or LANs between routers
- Ovals represent routers

We have the routing table of router D

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-04%2023.44.02.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-04 23.44.02" style="zoom:80%;" />

30 seconds later D receives new routing update from Router A

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-04%2023.44.38.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-04 23.44.38" style="zoom:80%;" />

- A tells D: "Hey, now I can reach Z through 4 hops".
- I.e., now D can reach Z through $4+1=5$ hops

As 5 < 7 (the old number of hops to reach Z), D updates its routing table:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-05%2000.03.37.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-05 00.03.37" style="zoom:80%;" />

## OSPF: Open Shortest Path First 

### OSPF Basics

- **Interior** gateway protocol

- **Link state** protocol

  - Each router in the network needs to learn complete *topology* of the network (Otherwise, calculated paths are inconsistent)
    - Topology = Nodes and links with their costs (weights)

  - Each router separately computes shortest paths based on network topology
    - Dijkstra shortest path algorithm

#### OSPF in the Protocol Stack

OSPF is located on top of IP $\rightarrow$  OSPF uses an *unreliable* communication service

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-07%2011.51.52.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-07 11.51.52" style="zoom:80%;" />

#### Know the Neighbors

Each router 

- learns its neighbors and 
- monitors the state of the links to them

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-07%2011.56.39.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-07 11.56.39" style="zoom:80%;" />

#### Link States of a Router

- **Router ID of neighbors**: dynamically discovered by hello protocol

- Availability: dynamically discovered by hello protocol or physical layer
- Everything else is configured

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-07%2012.03.17.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-07 12.03.17" style="zoom:80%;" />

#### Pre-Configuration of OSPF Router

Each router is **pre-configured** with the following parameters

- **Router ID**: unique ID of a router in the network

- **Per-interface parameters**
  - Interface IP address (and mask)
  - Interface output cost ‚Äì metric
    - Typically, *inversely proportional* to link data rate

#### Routing Metric

Each link is associated with **link costs**

Example: prefer links with higher data rate
$$
\text { Cost }=\frac{\text { Reference Data Rate }}{\text { Interface Data Rate }}
$$

- $\text{Reference Data Rate}$ can be configured
  - E.g., to 1 $ùê∫ùëèùëñùë°/ùë†$ or 10 $ùê∫ùëèùëñùë°/ùë†$
  - Should be consistent across all routers in network

#### Link State Advertisement (LSA)

Each router constructs router **link state advertisements (LSAs)**

- Router LSAs consist of information about its neighbors and links
- Example

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-07%2012.19.30.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-07 12.19.30" style="zoom:80%;" />

Router floods its LSA on *all* its interfaces $\rightarrow$ All routers in the network must receive an identical copy of this LSA

![Êà™Â±è2021-03-07 12.47.21](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-07%2012.47.21.png)

#### Link State Database

- Each router maintains a link state database

  - Stores most recent LSAs from all other routers in the network

  ![Êà™Â±è2021-03-07 12.48.45](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-07%2012.48.45.png)

- Link state database is used to
  - Construct topology graph of the network  
  - Calculate routing table

{{% alert note %}} 

Routers have identical knowledge of network topology iff their link state databases are **synchronized**, i.e., they have identical content at all routers.

{{% /alert %}}

- Initial Synchronization of link state database

  - **(Re-)start** of a router

    New router has an empty link state database

  - Initial database synchronization

    - Router asks neighboring router to share its database Performed 
    - immediately after a ‚Äúhandshake‚Äù of the hello protocol 
    - Routers exchange LSA headers with each other

    - If an LSA is missing it is requested from the neighbor router

    $\rightarrow$ the routers are now considered as adjacent to each other

### Link State Advertisement

Example

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-07%2013.02.37.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-07 13.02.37" style="zoom:80%;" />

Each LSA is associated with a lifetime (**LS `Age`**)

- Set to ‚Äú0‚Äù by advertising router
  - When flooded, incremented by transmission delay (estimated value) 
  - As LSA is stored in database, Age is **incremented over time**

- When LSA‚Äôs age reaches **`MaxAge`**, LSA is considered **out-of-date** 
  - `MaxAge `is set to 1 hour

- Consequence: routers must refresh their LSAs every `LSRefreshTime`
  - `LSRefreshTime `is set to 30 minutes
  - Minimum value between generation of any particular LSA: 5 seconds

### Hello Protocol

- üéØ Goals
  - Ensure bi-directional communication between neighboring OSPF routers 
  - Establish and maintain logical adjacencies

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-07%2013.06.50.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-07 13.06.50" style="zoom:80%;" />

- Determines identity and liveliness of neighboring routers

#### Hello Message

- Contains own `router ID`
- Contains `router ID` of neighboring router, if known
  - If not yet known $\rightarrow$ `router ID` is set to `0.0.0.0`
  - If own `router ID` is contained in neighbor's hello message $\rightarrow$ Communication is considered to be **bi-directional**

- Destination IP address of hello message: `224.0.0.5` (multicast address, ‚Äú`AllSPFRouters`‚Äù)

  $\rightarrow$  hello message is received and processed only by OSPF routers

#### Simplified Workflow

- A router **periodically** sends a hello message on all its links 

  - *‚ÄúHello, I am R1, I am still here‚Äù*
  - If known, hello message contains `router ID` of neighboring router 
    - *‚Äúmy neighbor on this link is R2‚Äù*

  ![Êà™Â±è2021-03-07 13.17.49](/Users/EckoTan/Library/Application Support/typora-user-images/Êà™Â±è2021-03-07 13.17.49.png)

- If no hello message is received for a pre-defined period of time $\rightarrow$ the link is considered to be down ü§™
  - Standard value for periodic hello messages: every 10-30 seconds 
  - Fast hello extension: < 1 second

### OSPF Message

#### **Header** of OSPF messages

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-07%2013.27.37.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-07 13.27.37" style="zoom:67%;" />

- **Version**: OSPF Version, currently 2 for IPv4 and 3 for IPv6
- **Type**
  - Hello
  - database description
  - link state request
  - link state update
  - link state acknowledgement
- **Router ID**: ID of originating router
- **Area ID**: OSPF area
- **Checksum**: Internet checksum over entire OSPF message
- **AUType and Authentication**: Optional authentication of originating router

#### Link State Update Message

Structure of a Link State Advertisement

- Consists of a **header** and a **body**
- **LSA header**: contains information used to uniquely identify the LSA
  - Advertising router
  - Sequence number of LSA at advertising router 
  - ...
- **LSA body**: contains information of all operational links of the router
  - Associated cost
  - Type of link
  - Reachability information
  - ...

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-07%2013.32.39.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-07 13.32.39" style="zoom:67%;" />

LSA Header

- **LS Age**

  Time in seconds since LSA was originated

- **Options**
   Optional capabilities supported by OSPF domain

- **LS Type**
   Router LSA, network LSA ...

- **Link State ID**
   Uniquely identifies an LSA

- **Advertising Router**
   OSPF router ID of originating router

- **LS Sequence Number**
   Incremented each time a new LSA is generated

- **Checksum**
   Over entire message exept age field

- **Length**
   \#bytes for entire LSA including header

### Coping with Dynamic Changes

#### Issuing LSAs

- If nothing changes (link, router), nothing needs to be reported with respect to routing $\rightarrow$ **keep quiet**
  - LSAs are refreshed every 30 minutes
- Besides periodic refreshes, communication is only needed in case of changes
  - Interface changed to up or down 
  - Neighboring router on link is unreachable 
  - Configuration changes
- Minimum time between two consecutive LSAs of a router is set to 5 seconds (Due to stability reasons) 

#### Synchronized Link State Databases

üéØ Goal: link state databases of all routers need to have **identical** content (need to be **synchronized**)

Following actions are needed

- Ensure that each LSA is received by every router in the network (**[reliable flooding](#reliable-flooding)**)
- Ensure that all routers consistently either store or discard each LSA $\rightarrow$ fully deterministic comparison rules
- Ensure that expired LSAs are deleted from link state databases of every router

#### Reliable Flooding

- Reception of each LSA is **acknowledged** by neighboring router

  - Hop-by-hop acknowledgements

- Router **R** stores received LSA

  - If R **does not have** an LSA from the advertising router

  - If the received LSA is **newer** than the one in the database

    ```python
    def is_new_LSA(received_LSA, cur_stored_LSA, MAX_AGE=60):
        if received_LSA.sequence_Nr > cur_stored_LSA.sequence_Nr:
            return True
        elif received_LSA.sequence_Nr == cur_stored_LSA.sequence_Nr:
            if received_LSA.checksum > cur_stored_LSA.checksum or 
               cur_stored_LSA.age == MAX_AGE or 
               received_LSA.age < cur_stored_LSA.age: 
                return True
        else:
        	return False
            
    ```

    

- If R stores the LSA, it forwards it to its neighbors 
  - Uses multicast address `224.0.0.5` with hop limit of 1

#### LSA Flooding Example

Router R receives LSA from advertising router R1

- if `received_LSA.age == MAX_AGE` **and** no LSA from R1 is known

  $\rightarrow$ Send ACK and discard

- If there is no LSA from R1 in database **or** received LSA is newer $\rightarrow$
  - Store/replace LSA
  - Send ACK

  - Update Age and flood LSA to neighbors

- If already stored copy is newer

  $\rightarrow$ Send stored copy back to advertising router R1

- If LSA and stored copy are the same

  $\rightarrow$ Discard LSA

Re-compute routes if content of link state database changed

### OSPF Areas

- Basic situation: Autonomous systems can grow rather large

- Scalability problem

  - LSA flooding and
  - Route computation overhead

  $\rightarrow$ do NOT scale ü§™

- üîß Solution: Divide an AS into **areas** (i.e., introduce additional level of hierarchy)
  - Apply routing only within an area 
    - LSA flooding and route computation limited to an area
    - Only routers within the same area have identical link state databases.
  - Areas exchange summary information with each other
    - Addresses reachable from these areas
  - Typical size of an area: <100 routers

### OSPF Areas structure

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-08%2016.47.53.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-08 16.47.53" style="zoom:80%;" />

- Two levels of hierarchy
  - **Area 0** ‚Äì **backbone** of the autonomous system Backbone must be always connected
  - All other areas are directly connected to backbone
- **Area border routers (ABRs)** interconnect areas
  - They belong to both: their area and the backbone

  - They run an instance of OSPF for each area they are connected to
  - They generate summary LSAs
    - Contain ABR‚Äôs routing table for corresponding area
      - List of destinations reachable within the area 
      - Associated with path cost from the ABR to destination
    - ABR ÃÅs routing table is constructed after intra-area path computation
  - Handle summary LSAs: Same way as ‚Äúregular‚Äù LSAs
    - ABR forward summary LSAs of an area into backbone 
    - ABR forward summary LSAs from backbone into the area

### Inter-Area Forwarding

- Data between areas are forwarded through backbone (area 0)
- End-to-end path consists of **path segments**
  - Segment between source and ABR of originating area 
  - Segment between two ABRs in area 0, and

  - Segment between ABR of target area and destination
- Routers within an area select ABRs so that resulting end-to-end path is a **shortest** path
  - Based on path costs of ABRs

### RIP vs. OSPF

**RIP**: based on distance vector

- üî¥ Problems
  - Limited in metric selection and size  
    - Only one metric (hop count)

    - Maximum path length of 15 hops
  - Periodic updates every 30 seconds, even without changes
  - Slow convergence, count-to-infinity $\rightarrow$ Not suitable for large networks ü§™

- üëç Advantage: easier and requires less resources than OSPF 
  - Still sometimes used in small networks

**OSPF**: based on link-state

- Addresses shortcomings of RIP
  - Faster convergence, no count-to-infinity, lower signaling overhead ... üëè
- Large networks can be divided into areas 
- Standard in large ASes (together with IS-IS)
