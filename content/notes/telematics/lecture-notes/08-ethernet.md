## Aloha, Slotted Aloha

### Aloha

First MAC protocol for packet-based wireless networks

- Media access control (MAC)

  - Time multiplex, variable, random access
  - NO previous sensing of medium and no announcement of intended transmission
  - **Asynchronous** access

- üî¥ Problem: Collision possible

- Schema

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-18%2012.02.54.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-18 12.02.54" style="zoom:67%;" />

### Slotted Aloha

- Like Aloha, but

  - Uses time slots
    - **Synchronized** access only at beginning of time slot

  - On average **less** collisions than with Aloha

- Schema

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-18%2012.05.04.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-18 12.05.04" style="zoom:67%;" />

### Evaluation

How well can the capacity of the medium be utilized?

#### Evaluation of Slotted Aloha

- Assumptions
  - Based on the design
    - All systems start transmissions at beginning of time slot 
    - All systems work synchronized
  - Simplifications
    - All packets have same length and fit into one time slot
      - If a collision arises, all systems notice it before end of the time slot 
    - All systems always want to send data
      - Every system sends in each time slot with a probability of $ùëù$ 
    - If a collision occurs
      - Packet will be repeated with a probability of $ùëù$ in all following time slots until the transmission is successful

- There are $ùëÅ$ active systems in the network
  - Probability that a system starts sending: $ùëù$
  - Probability that $ùëÅ ‚àí 1$ systems are not sending: $(1 - p)^{N-1}$
  - Probability that a given system succeeds: $p(1 - p)^{N-1}$
  - Probability for successful transmission of any one system: $Np(1 - p)^{N-1}$

- Seeking for maximum utilization $U\_{max}$

  - Need $p^*$ s.t. $Np(1 - p)^{N-1}$ reaches its maximum

    - Solution: $p^\* = \frac{1}{N}$

  - Therefore: 

    
    $$
    \begin{array}{l}
    &N p^{\*}\left(1-p^{\*}\right)^{N-1}=\left(1-\frac{1}{N}\right)^{N-1}\\\\
    &\displaystyle{\lim \_{N \rightarrow \infty}}\left(1-\frac{1}{N}\right)^{N-1}=\frac{1}{e}\\\\
    &U\_{\max }=\frac{1}{e}=0.36
    \end{array}
    $$

#### Evaluation of Aloha

- Simplifying assumptions

  - All packets have same length 
  - Immediate notification about collisions
  - On collision: Packet will be repeated immediately with probability $ùëù$
  - On successful transmission
    - Wait for transmission time of packet
    - Then: continue sending with probability $ùëù$ and continue waiting with probability $1 ‚àí ùëù$

- Observation: Collision occurs

  ‚Äã	a) if previous packet from other system has not been send completely, **or**

  ‚Äã	b) if other system starts sending before ongoing transmission is finished

- There are $ùëÅ$ active systems in the network

  - Probability that a system starts sending: $ùëù$
  - Probability for (a) and (b): $(1 - p)^{N-1}$
  - Probability for successful transmission of any one system: $Np(1 - p)^{2(N-1)}$

- Further observations as for Slotted Aloha
  $$
  \begin{array}{l}
  \displaystyle{\lim\_{N \rightarrow \infty}} \frac{N}{2 N-1}\left(1-\frac{1}{2 N-1}\right)^{2(N-1)}=\frac{1}{2 e} \\\\
  \Rightarrow U_{\max }=\frac{1}{2 e}=0.18
  \end{array}
  $$

#### Comparison of Utilization Between Aloha and Slotted Aloha

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-18%2012.25.40.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-18 12.25.40" style="zoom:67%;" />

## CSMA-based Approaches

**CSMA** = **C**arrier **S**ense **M**ultiple **A**ccess

- **CSMA/CD** 
  - **CD** = **C**ollision **D**etection ("Listen before talk, listen while talk‚Äú)
  - Sending system can detect collisions by listening
  - Usage example: Ethernet
- **CSMA/CA**
  - **CA** = **C**ollision **A**voidance
  - Sending system assumes collisions when acknowledgement is missing
    - MAC-layer acknowledgements, stop-and-wait
  - Usage example: WLAN

## Ethernet Variants

### The Original

- Standardized as **IEEE 802.3**

- Medium access control

  - Time multiplex, variable, random access 
  - Asynchronous access

  - Uses CSMA/CD
    - Collisions detection through listening 
    - Exponential backoff

    - 1-persistent

  - Network topology 
    - Originally: Bus topology

  - Data rate
    - Originally: 10 Mbit/s

  - Wire based
    - Originally: Coaxial cable

- Standard consists of 

  - Layer 1 and

  - Layer 2a (MAC-Protocol)

- CSMA/CD-based approach

  - Check medium

    - Considered free if no activity is detected for **96 bit times** 
      - 96 bit times = **Inter Frame Space (IFS)**

  - Sending: **1-persistent**

    > 1-persistent
    >
    > 1-persistent CSMA is an aggressive transmission algorithm. When the transmitting node is ready to transmit, it senses the transmission medium for idle or busy. 
    >
    > - If idle, then it transmits immediately. 
    > - If busy, then it senses the transmission medium continuously until it becomes idle, then transmits the message (a [frame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(telecommunications))) unconditionally (i.e. with probability=1). 
    > - In case of a [collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_(telecommunications)), the sender waits for a [random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness) period of time and attempts the same procedure again. 
    >
    > 1-persistent CSMA is used in CSMA/CD systems including [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet).

  - Collision detection by sender
    - Abort sending
    - Send jamming signal (length of 48 bit, format `1010...`)
    - Ensure collision detection: Minimum length of frame
  - Exponential backoff for repeated transmissions

#### Collision Detection

- Collision detection by **sender**

  - Detection must happen before transmission is finished

    $\rightarrow$ We need Minimum duration for sending

    - Doubled maximum propagation delay $t\_a$ of the medium

      $\rightarrow$ **Minimum length** of a 802.3-MAC frame required

  - In case of shorter frames

    - No reliable collision detection ü§™
    - No CSMA/CD, only CSMA ü§™

- How to enforce minimum frame length?
  - Implemented transparently for the application
    - I.e., application can transmit small portions of data if desired
  - Frame is extended by **padding field (PAD)**

#### Ethernet Frame

Structure

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-18%2012.36.37.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-18 12.36.37" style="zoom:67%;" />

Between two frames: **IFS**

#### Evaluation Ethernet: Utilization

- üéØ Goal: Derive upper bound of utilization $U\_{max}$

- Assumption

  - **Perfect protocol**

    - No transmission errors, no overhead, no processing time, ...

  - Achieved throughput
    $$
    r\_{e}=\frac{X}{t\_{s}+t\_{a}}=\frac{X}{X / r+d / v}
    $$

    - $r\_e$: effective data rate
    - $X$: \#bits to transmit
    - $t\_a$: propagation delay
    - $t\_s$: transmission delay
    - $r$: data rate
    - $d$: medium distance
    - $v$: transmission speed

  - Parameter $ùëé$ often used for performance evaluation
    $$
    a= \frac{\text{propagation delay}}{\text{transmission delay}} = \frac{t\_{a}}{t\_{s}}=\frac{d / v}{X / r}=\frac{r d}{X v}
    $$

  - Utilization under optimal circumstances
    $$
    U\_{\max }=\frac{r\_{e}}{r}=\frac{1}{1+a}
    $$

  - Local network with $ùëÅ$ active systems

    - Each system can always send a frame
    - System sends frames with probability $ùëù$

  - Maximum normalized propagation delay of $ùëé$

    - I.e., transmission time $t\_s$ of each frame is normalized to 1

  - Time is logically partitioned in time slots

    - Length is doubled end-to-end propagation delay (i.e., $2a$)	

- Observations

  - Two types of time intervals 

  - **Transmission intervals**: $\frac{1}{2a}$ time slots

    > - Transmission time $t\_s$ is normalized to 1
    > - Length of each time slot is $2a$
    >
    > $\Rightarrow$ We need $\frac{1}{2a}$ time slots

  - **Collision intervals**: collisions or no transmissions

  $$
  U\_{\max }=\frac{\text { Transmission interval }}{\text { Transmission interval }+\text { Collision interval }}
  $$

- Evaluation
  $$
  \lim \_{N \rightarrow \infty} U\_{\max }=\frac{1}{1+3.44 a}
  $$

    <details>
    <summary>Details</summary>

    Average length $l\_k$ of a collision interval (measured in time slots) 

    - Probability $A$ that exactly one system is sending:
      $$
      A = Np(1 - p)^{N-1}
      $$

    - Function has maximum at $p^\* = \frac{1}{N} \Rightarrow A^\* = (1 - \frac{1}{N})^{N-1}$

    - Probability that in $i$ following time slots a collision or no transmission occurs,

      followed by a time slot with transmission 
      $$
      \left(1-A^{\*}\right)^{i} A^{\*}
      $$

    - Average length $l\_k$:
      $$
      E\left[l\_{k}\right]=\sum\_{i=1}^{\infty} i\left(1-A^{\*}\right)^{i} A^{\*} \to \frac{1-A^\*}{A\*}
      $$

    Therefore
  $$
    U\_{\max }=\frac{\text { Transmission interval }}{\text { Transmission interval }+\text { Collision interval }} = \frac{1 /(2 a)}{1 /(2 a)+\left(1-A^{\*}\right) / A^{\*}}=\frac{1}{1+2 a\left(1-A^{\*}\right) / A^{\*}}
  $$
    For increasing number $N$ of systems
  $$
    \lim \_{N \rightarrow \infty} A^{\*}=\lim \_{N \rightarrow \infty}\left(1-\frac{1}{N}\right)^{N-1}=1 / e
  $$

  $$
    \Rightarrow \lim \_{N \rightarrow \infty} U\_{\max }=\frac{1}{1+3.44 a}
  $$

### Summary

- Today ÃÅs Ethernet is very different from the original version developed by Metcalf and Boggs
- One constant has remained: The Ethernet frame format

## Spanning Tree

### Bridges

- üéØ Goal: Connect local area networks (LANs) on **layer 2**

- Properties

  - Filter function: Detaches intra-network traffic in one LAN from inter-network-traffic to other LANs

- Schema

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-18%2014.43.57.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-18 14.43.57" style="zoom:67%;" />

- Types

  - **Source-Routing bridges**

    - End systems add forwarding information in send packets
      - Bridges forward the packets based on this information

      - Sending packets is **NOT transparent** for the end system ‚Äì it has to know the path
    - Technically easy but not often used in practice ü§™

  - **Transparent bridges**

    - Local forwarding decisions in each bridge

      - Forwarding information normally stored in a table (forwarding table) 
      - Static entries as well as dynamically learned entries

    - End system is NOT involved in forwarding decisions

      $\rightarrow$ Existence of bridges is transparent to end systems

    - Often used in practice (e.g., switches)

  - Comparison

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-18%2014.46.50.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-18 14.46.50" style="zoom:67%;" />

#### Transparent Bridges resp. Switches

Important features

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-18%2014.49.28.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-18 14.49.28" style="zoom:67%;" />



- For each network interface exists an **own layer 1 and MAC instance**

- Data path: Through MAC relay (implements forwarding on layer 2)
- Control path
  - E.g., bridge protocol, bridge management
  - Logical Link Control (LLC) instances are involved

#### Basic Tasks

- Establishing a **loop-free topology**

  - s.t. Packets must not loop endlessly in the network

  $\rightarrow$ **[Spanning-tree algorithm](#spanning-tree-algorithm)**

- **Forwarding of packets**

  - Learning the ‚Äúlocation‚Äù of end systems 
    - Creation of the forwarding table

  - Filtering resp. forwarding of packets
    - Based on the information of the forwarding table

### Spanning-Tree Algorithm

- Task

  - Organize bridges in a **tree topology** (NO loops!)
    - **Nodes**: bridges and local networks
    - **Edges**: connections between interfaces and local networks

  - Not all bridges have to be part of the tree topology
    - Resources might not be used optimally

- Forwarding of packets (Only possible along the tree)

- **Bridge protocol** implements the Spanning-Tree algorithm

- Requirements for using the bridge protocol
  - Group address to address all bridges in the network
  - Unique bridge identifier per bridge in the network

  - Unique interface identifier per interface in each bridge

  - Path costs for all interfaces of a bridge have to be known

#### BPDUs

- Bridges send special packets: **Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs)**

- BPDU contains (among others)
  - Identifier of the **sending bridge**

  - Identifier of the bridge that is assumed as **root bridge** 
  - **Path cost** from sending bridge to root bridge

#### Basic Steps

1. Determine **root bridge**

   - Initially
     - Bridges have no topology information
     - All bridges: assumption: ‚ÄúI am the root bridge‚Äù
       - Periodically send BPDU with itself as root bridge 
       - Bridges only relay BPDUs, no ‚Äúnormal‚Äù packets
   - Receiving BPDU with **smaller** bridge identifier
     - Bridge no longer assumes that it is the root bridge 
     - No longer issues own BPDUs
   - When receiving BPDU possibly update of the configuration
     - BPDU contains root bridge with smaller identifier
     - BPDU with same root bridge identifier but cheaper path to root bridge
     - Bridge notices that it is not the designated bridge $\rightarrow$ No longer forwards BPDUs

2. Determine **root interfaces** for each bridge

   - Calculate the path costs to the root bridge (Sum over costs of all interfaces on path to the root bridge)
   - Select interface with the lowest costs

3. Determine **designated bridge** for each LAN (loop free!)

   - LAN can have multiple bridges

   - Select bridge with lowest costs on root interface
   - Responsible for forwarding of packets
   - Other bridges in the LAN will be deactivated

#### Stable Phase

- Root bridge periodically issues BPDUs 
  - Only ‚Äúactive‚Äù bridges forward BPDUs
- No more BPDUs are received
  - Bridge again assumes that it is the root bridge 
  - Algorithm re-starts
- After stabilization packets are forwarded over the respective ports
  - Based on the entries in the forwarding table

#### Example 1

### Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)

- Overview of some relevant changes
  - **New port states**
    - **Alternate Port**: best alternative path to root bridge
    - **Backup Port**: alternative path to a network that already has a connection
      - Bridge has two ports which connect to the same network
  - **Sending BPDUs**
    - are additionally used as ‚Äúkeep-alive‚Äù messages
    - Every bridge sends periodic BPDUs (Hello-Timer = 2s) 
      - To the next hierarchy level in the tree

      - Failure of a neighbor: no BPDU for 3 times

- Example
