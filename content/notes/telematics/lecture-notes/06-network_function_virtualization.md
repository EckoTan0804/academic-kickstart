## Network Functions

### Middleboxes and Network Functions

- **Middlebox**

  - Device on the data path between a source and destination end system
  - Performs functions other than normal, standard functions of an IP route

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-14%2011.06.02.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-14 11.06.02" style="zoom:80%;" />

- **Network function**
  - Functionality of a middlebox 
  - Executed on the data path
  - *E.g. [Network address translation (NAT)](#network-address-translation-nat), [firewall](#firewall), proxy, load balancing, intrusion detection, ...*

#### Network Address Translation (NAT)

Connects a realm with **private addresses** to an external realm with **globally unique addresses**

- Problem: private addresses cannot be used for routing in the Internet

- Solution: Exchange globally unique and private addresses when packets traverse network boundaries

  $\rightarrow$ Clients in the private address range can share globally unique addresses

- Example

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-14%2011.13.14.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-14 11.13.14" style="zoom:67%;" />

#### Firewall

- Monitors and controls incoming and outgoing traffic

  - Establishes barrier between trusted and untrusted networks 
  - Forwards or drops packets based on pre-defined rule set

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-14%2011.14.28.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-14 11.14.28" style="zoom:80%;" />

- Variants. e.g.
  - **Shallow vs. deep packet inspection**
    - **Shallow**: decisions are based on header fields only (e.g., IP and TCP protocol information)
    - Deep: inspects content of higher layer protocols (e.g., detection of malware traffic in application layer protocols)
  - **Stateful vs. stateless processing**
    - **Stateless**: every packet is inspected independently of other packets
    - **Stateful**: keeps state between packets (e.g., for every TCP connection to detect invalid sequence numbers)

### Traditional Middlebox Deployment

Example: Caching

- Single content provider

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-14%2011.18.32.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-14 11.18.32" style="zoom: 67%;" />

- Multiple content providers

  Place multiple middleboxes at different locations in the network

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-14%2011.19.00.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-14 11.19.00" style="zoom: 67%;" />

- üî¥ Problems

  - Middleboxes are often build as proprietary hardware
    - Fast, but very inflexible
    - Usually closed sourceÔÉ†blackbox for infrastructure operator

  - Static wiring
    - Hard to setup / tear down
    - Hard to move
    - Hard to upgrade $\rightarrow$ introduce new or bigger boxes
  - Network operators have to manage many different vendor-specific boxes

### Network Function Virtualization (NFV)

üí°Mimic ideas of cloud computing

- Implement network functions in software
- Use virtualization technology to decouple network functions from hardware 
- Consolidate functionality on high volume servers, switches and storage

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-14%2011.21.37.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-14 11.21.37" style="zoom: 67%;" />

Network services combine multiple network functions

- End-to-end behavior of a network service is the combination of the
  individual network functions

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-14%2011.23.10.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-14 11.23.10" style="zoom:67%;" />

üëç Benefits

- **Resource sharing**
  Single platform for different applications and users

- **Agility and flexibility**
  Services can scale to address changing demands

- **Rapid deployment and innovation cycles**

  Providers can easily trial and evolve services

- **Reduced costs**

Consider the caching example above: Networks provide infrastructure for executing software-based network functions (**NFV Infrastructure, NFVI**)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-14%2011.27.44.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-14 11.27.44" style="zoom:67%;" />

#### Main Building Blocks of NFV

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-14%2011.31.12.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-14 11.31.12" style="zoom:67%;" />

- **Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs)**

  - The actual network functions provided in software 
  - Independent of its deployment (e.g., hardware)

- **NFV Management and Orchestration (MANO)**

  - Lifecycle management of VNFs and network services 
  - Requests resources for VNFs

- **NFV Infrastructure (NFVI)**

  - Provides hardware, software and network resources for VNFs 
  - Decouples VNFs from underlying hardware
  - Can contain multiple Points of Presence (PoP)
    - Small data centers, located at different points in the infrastructure
  - SDN is used to transparently reroute flows to PoPs
    - Could also be done with MPLS or other technologies 
    - SDN and NFV complement each other very well

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-14%2012.05.20.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-14 12.05.20" style="zoom:67%;" />

  - Simple deployment example

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-14%2012.06.11.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-14 12.06.11" style="zoom: 67%;" />



## Virtualization

- Provides a **software abstraction layer** between

  - Hardware and
  - Operating system and applications running in a virtual machine

  $\rightarrow$ Offers a standardized platform for applications

- The abstraction layer is referred to as **hypervisor**
  - "Resource broker" between hardware and virtual machines
  - Translates I/O from virtual machines to physical server devices 
  - Allows multiple operating systems to coexist on a single physical host 
  - Allows live migration of virtual machines to other hosts

### Type 1 Hypervisor

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-14%2012.09.01.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-14 12.09.01" style="zoom: 67%;" />

- Runs **directly on hardware** 
  - High performance
  - Strong isolation between virtual machines
- Synchronizes the access of virtual machines to the hardware

### Type 2 Hypervisor

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-14%2012.10.35.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-14 12.10.35" style="zoom: 67%;" />

- Runs **on top of a host operating system**
  - Hypervisor is executed as an application in user space
- Virtual machines provide **virtual hardware** to guest operating systems
  - Interaction with virtual hardware is directed to physical devices through a
    virtual machine driver or the host operating system

### Container-Based Virtualization

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-14%2012.14.00.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-14 12.14.00" style="zoom: 67%;" />

- Single kernel provides multiple **instances (containers)** of same host operating system

  - No hypervisor involved

  - Isolation of containers is enforced by host operating system kernel 

    - Each container has its own view of the operating system

  - Applications in containers are executed by the host operating system

    $\rightarrow$ Applications depend on host operating system

- Kernel synchronizes access of containers to the hardware

## Service Function Chaining (SFC)

- Ordered set of network functions
  - Specifies ordering constraints that must be applied to flows
- Enables the creation of composite network services
  - Transparent to end systems
- Examples 
  - Firewall $\rightarrow$ authentication server 
  - Load balancer $\rightarrow$ cache
  - ...

### Example: Advanced Caching Scenario

- Place additional firewall, authentication and cache on the data path

- Sketch
  1. Required VNFs are instantiated at appropriate PoPs

     <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-14%2012.39.24.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-14 12.39.24" style="zoom: 67%;" />

  2. Service function chain is established (flow table entries in the data plane)

      $\rightarrow$  Flow table entries enforce correct order of VNF traversal

     <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/NFV_example.gif" alt="NFV_example" style="zoom:67%;" />

### MPLS-based Service Function Chaining

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-14%2012.28.15.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-14 12.28.15" style="zoom: 67%;" />

- **Service classifiers** select appropriate service function chains (step 1)

  - Select traffic to be processed in the chain
  - Attach a stack of MPLS labels to packets to determine their path through the chain

- **Service function forwarders** deliver packets to network functions

  - The service function indicated by the topmost MPLS label is applied 
  - The topmost label is removed from the stack afterwards

  (step 2 - 4)

  - Normal traffic flow resumes when the MPLS stack is empty (step 5)
