## Introduction

### Circuit Switching

‚ÄûCircuit‚Äú

- Logical circuit with reserved resources for data transmission
  - no physical cable!
- No meta data (header, appendix) required during data exchange 
- No buffer overflows in intermediate systems!
- But: possibly bad resource utilization
- Use case: telephone network

## ISDN

{{< figure src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/ISDN.png" caption="ISDN summary" numbered="true" >}}

**ISDN** = **I**ntegrated **S**ervices **D**igital **N**etwork

- üéØ Goals
  - **Digital** up to the subscriber
  - **Integration** of different services (e.g., voice, data, images)
- Offering additional services 
  - Redialing
  - Direct call
  - Automatic call-back if receiver access is busy 
  - Re-direction of calls
  - ...

### Architecture

Clear Separation of Access and Network

Simplified Architecture at Subscriber Interface

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-24%2022.33.06.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-24 22.33.06" style="zoom:67%;" />



- **Network Termination (NT)**

  - Termination of technical transmission
    - Of network ($U\_{k0}$ interface)
    - Of subscriber installation ($S\_0$ interface)
  - Power supply for subscriber installation

  - Detect frame errors

- **Local telephone switch**

  - Media access to signaling channel (D channel, layer 2) 
  - Signaling at layer 3
  - ...

- **Adaptor**: Provide ISDN functionality for non-ISDN capable device

#### ISDN Subscriber Interface

Basic access

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-24%2022.37.29.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-24 22.37.29" style="zoom:67%;" />

- 2 ‚àó 64kbit/s+16kbit/s ($2 ‚àó ùêµ + ùê∑\_{16}$)
- Two types of logical channels
  - B channel: data transfer
  - D channel: signaling traffic

**B channel**

- User data transmission
- Data rate: 64 kbit/s
- Two B channels available
  - Operate independent of each other
  - Can transmit in different directions
  - Can transmit different data types (voice, images, ...) 
  - Do not have to (but can) be active at the same time
- Medium access 
  - Fixed
  - Time slots are associated with either B channel

**D Channels**

- **Signaling** (establish B channel between end systems)
- Data rate: 16 kbit/s
- Bidirectional communication: end system <--> network termination
- Medium access

**E(cho) channel**

- Data rate: 16 kbit/s
- Unidirectional communication: network termination --> end system
- Required for medium access
  - Carrier sensing (CS)
  - Collision detection (CD)

Channels and Layering

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-24%2022.42.42.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-24 22.42.42" style="zoom: 67%;" />

- Subscriber installation
  - B channels
    - Layer 1 standardized
    - Layers 2-7 usage dependent
  - D channel: Layers 1-3 standardized

### Subscriber Interface

#### Subscriber Interface $S\_0$

- Four-wire transmission

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-24%2022.54.14.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-24 22.54.14" style="zoom:67%;" />

  - **One twin conductor per direction**
  - **Simplex** operation, both directions separated

- Multiplexing at $S\_0$ interface
  - **Space division multiplex**: Separation of directions
  - **Time division multiplex**: Frame structure ($S\_0$ frames)

#### Bus Topology at $S\_0$ Interface

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-24%2022.55.45.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-24 22.55.45" style="zoom:80%;" />

- Each end system has two connections to the bus
  - In direction to network termination: **write** access
  - In direction to end system: **read** access

#### $S\_0$ Frames

Time division multiplex in both directions

- End system --> network termination

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-24%2022.58.20.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-24 22.58.20" style="zoom:67%;" />

- End system <-- network termination

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-24%2022.57.58.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-24 22.57.58" style="zoom:67%;" />

  - NT mirrors D channel into echo channel of incoming $S\_0$ frames

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-24%2023.05.29.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-24 23.05.29" style="zoom:67%;" />

#### Channel Encoding

- Inverse AMI code (0 "overwrites" 1)

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-24%2023.06.40.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-24 23.06.40" style="zoom:67%;" />

  - 0: alternating by positive or negative level over whole tact interval 
  - 1: represented by 0 level

### D Channel: Medium Access

- Systems access D channel independent of each other 
  - E.g., to establish a connection

- CSMA/CD based approach

  - **Check medium** (echo channel as mirror of D channel)

    -  Free, when there is no activity visible for a duration of 8 bit

      - Protocol on layer 2 in D channel is variant of HDLC

      - Format of an HDLC frame

        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-24%2023.12.12.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-24 23.12.12" style="zoom:67%;" />

        - Delimited by flag (`01111110`)

        - **Bit stuffing** to conserve data transparency for higher layers

          <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-24%2023.15.50.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-24 23.15.50" style="zoom:80%;" />

          - After 5 subsequent binary ‚Äú1‚Äù sender adds a binary ‚Äú0‚Äù 
            - This happens inbetween the flags
          - After 5 subsequent binary ‚Äú1‚Äù receiver removes a following binary ‚Äú0‚Äù
          - Bit stuffing is done when sending the bit stream 
            - Calculate checksum before bit stuffing
          - ‚ÄúInversed‚Äù bit stuffing when receiving bit stream 
            - Verify checksum after ‚Äúinversed‚Äù bit stuffing

    - 8 bit no activity on D channel represents 8 ones (inverse AMI-code)

  - **Send**: 1-persistent

  - **Collision detection** through sending system

    - Systems listen on E channel while sending
    - Other signal received on E channel than send on D channel? 
      - 0 overwrites 1
    - Detecting system aborts sending and continues to check medium
      - No further bit is send on D channel
      - No exponential backoff
    - Other system does not note anything and continues sending successfully

## DSL

**DSL** = **D**igital **S**ubscriber **L**ine

- üéØ Goal

  - Performant solution for subscriber connection
  - Support data services with higher data rates

- ‚ÄúInvariant‚Äù: Twin conductor at the U interface = connection to customer premise

- Categories

  - **ADSL (Asymmetric DSL)**

    - Follows the typical communication model of the WWW

      - A lot of data is received from the server

      - Much less own data is send to the server

    - Downstream and upstream data rates are **asymmetric**

      - Downstream (From server to subscriber): 768 kbit/s ‚Äì 8 Mbit/s
      - Upstream (From subscriber to server): 128 kbit/s ‚Äì 576 kbit/s

    - Subscriber connection

      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-24%2023.23.53.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-24 23.23.53" style="zoom:80%;" />

      - **Splitter**
        - Separates signal in telephone and data signal
        - Required at subscriber as well as in telephone switch
        - Works passive: Telephone signal stays available even when splitter fails
      - **Copper twin conductor**
        - Between splitters at subscriber and telephone switch
      - **DSLAM**
        - DSL Access Multiplexer

        - Counterpart to DSL modem at subscriber

  - **SDSL (Symmetric DSL)**

    - Mainly used by business customers
    - Most often much more expensive than ADSL 
    - Only data, i.e., no parallel phone calls possible

### Data Transmission at DSL Access

#### Frequency Multiplexing

Different frequencies for

- Telephony
- DSL upstream
- DSL downstream

![Êà™Â±è2021-03-28 23.39.41](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-28%2023.39.41.png)

#### Sources of Signal Disturbance

**Damping**: primary influenced by three parameters

- Distance, interference, cable diameter
  - Damping decreases with increasing cable diameter

  - --> Larger diameter permits higher data rates on same distance

**Crosstalk**

- Interference between sender and receiver
- Interference between senders --> Only some twin conductors of a cable bundle can be used for ADSL

- **BRAS: Broadband Remote Access Server**
  - Part of the ISPs core network
  - Tasks
    - Routes traffic to/from broadband access devices (e.g., DSLAM) 
    - Aggregates traffic of multiple DSLAMs

    - Can support policy management, quality-of-service
    - Provides layer-2-connectivity
    - Provide layer-3-connectivity
    - Interfaces to AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)
    - Assigns IP addresses to clients

#### Setting up an ADSL Connection

Provider is at the same time network provider: Use **PPP (point-to-point protocol)**

- **Establish** phase --> LCP (link control protocol)
  - Setup PPP connection

  - Negotiate connection parameters
    - Data rate, used carriers 
  - Negotiate authentication method
  - Negotiate the Data Rate
    - Fixed rate
      - Data rate is set to fixed value
      - Contains ‚Äúsafety margin‚Äù
    - Adaptive rate
      - Negotiate the maximum reachable data rate
- **Authentication** phase
  - Authentication based on negotiated method
- **Network** phase
  - Assignment of IP address
  - Announcing address of the DNS server

Provider uses DSL resale link

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-25%2000.42.48.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-25 00.42.48" style="zoom:67%;" />

- Sequence
  - Abort previous sequence in the authentication phase
    - Only at this time it is known that subscriber is customer of different provider
  - Thereafter
    - Forwarding all data to other provider
    - Restart complete sequence

  - Downstream
    - Broadcast: all subscribers receive same signal 
    - Cable modem filters out ‚Äúown‚Äù packets
  - Upstream
    - Access to channels controlled by time multiplex (time slots) 
    - Time slots are assigned by CMTS in the head-end
  - Shared medium: Reachable data rate depends on number of concurrent users
