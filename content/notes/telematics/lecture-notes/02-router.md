## Basic Functionalities

### Intermediate Systems

- Forward data from input port(s) to output port(s)

  - Forwarding is a task of the **data path**

    ![Êà™Â±è2021-03-01 11.31.22](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-01%2011.31.22.png)

- May operate on different layers
  - Hubs operate on layer 1 
  - Bridges operate on layer 2 
  - **Routers operate on layer 3**

### Routing

- **Determines the path that the packets follow**

- Routing is part of the control path
  $\rightarrow$ Requires **routing algorithms** and **routing protocols**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-01%2011.34.13.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-01 11.34.13" style="zoom:80%;" />

### Forwarding within a Router

**Main task**

- Lookup in forwarding table
- Forward data from input port to output port(s)

üéØ **Goals**

- Forwarding in line **speed** 
- **Short** queues
- **Small** tables

Schematic View of an IP-Router:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-01%2011.47.21.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-01 11.47.21" style="zoom:80%;" />

### Forwarding Functionality

**Basic functions**

- Check the headers of an IP packet 
  - Version number
  - Valid header length 
  - Checksum
- Check time to live 
  - Decrement of TTL field
- Recalculate checksum
- Lookup
  - Determine output port for a packet
- Fragmentation 
- Handle IP options

**Possibly: differentiated treatment of packets**

- Classification
- Prioritization

## Challenge: Line Speed

- Bandwidth demand increases
- Link capacity has to increase as well to keep up

### Types of Routers

- **Core router**
  - Used by **service providers**
  - Need to handle large amounts of aggregated traffic
  - High speed and reliability essential
    - Fast lookup and forwarding needed

    - Redundancy to increase reliability (dual power supply ...)
  - Cost secondary issue

- **Enterprise router**
  - Connect end systems in **companies, universities** ...

  - Provide connectivity to large number of end systems

  - Support of VLANs, firewalls ...

  - Low cost per port, large number of ports, ease of maintenance

- **Edge router (access router)**
  - At edge of service provider

  - Provide connectivity to customer from **home, small businesses** 
  - Support for PPTP, IPsec, VPNs ...

## Forwarding Table Lookup

Example of a forwarding table

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-01%2012.18.53.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-01 12.18.53" style="zoom:80%;" />

**Prefix**

- Identifies a block of addresses
- Continuous blocks of addresses per output port are beneficial
  - Does not require a separate entry for each IP address $\rightarrow$ **Scalability** üëè

**Longest Prefix Matching**

- Consider a typical problem: What to do if there are multiple prefixes in the forwarding table that match on a given destination address?
- üîß Solution: Select *most specific* prefix
  - **most specific prefix = the longest prefix**
- Example

![Êà™Â±è2021-03-01 12.22.49](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-01%2012.22.49.png)

**Efficient Prefix Search**

Different approaches for fast prefix search (in software)

- [Binary trie]($binary-trie$) 
- [Path-compressed trie](#path-compression) 
- [Multibit-Tries](#multibit-trie)
- [Hash tables](#hash-tables)

### Efficient data structures

Requirements

- Fast lookup
- Low memory
- Fast updates

#### NaiÃàve approach: Simple Array

- Variables
  - $N$ = number of prefixes
  - $W$ = length of a prefix (e.g., $W=32$ for full IPv4 addresses) 
  - $k$ = length of a stride (only for multibit tries)

- How it works?
  - Store prefixes in a simple array (unordered)

  - Linear search

  - Remember best match while walking through array
  - Evaluation
    - Worst case lookup speed: $O(N)$ $\rightarrow$ pretty bad ü§™
    - Memory requirement: $O(N \cdot W)$ $\rightarrow$ pretty bad ü§™
    - Updates: $O(1)$

#### Binary Trie

- **Tries** $\rightarrow$ tree-based data structures to store and search prefix information 

  - From ‚Äûre**trie**val‚Äú (find something)

- üí° **Idea: Bits in the prefix tell the algorithms what branch to take**

- Example

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-01%2012.58.32.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-01 12.58.32" style="zoom:80%;" />

- Evaluation

  - Worst case lookup speed: $O(W)$
    - Maximum of one node per bit in the prefix 
    - But much better than naiÃàve approach ($W \ll N$)
  - Memory requirement: $O(N \cdot W)$ 
    - Assumption: prefixes stored as linked list starting from root node
    - Every prefix (out of $N$) can have up to $W$ nodes $\rightarrow$ Maximum of $N \cdot W$ entries
    - No improvement (compared with naiÃàve approach) ü§™
  - Updates: $O(W)$
    - A maximum of $W$ nodes has to be inserted or deleted (similar to lookup procedure)

- Performance

  - Can find prefix in $W$ steps $\rightarrow$ address space = $2^W$

    - $W = $  number of bits in address ($W = 32$ for IPv4, $W = 128$ for IPv6)

  - Assumption: separate memory access required for each step

    - Memory access time $t\_{\text{access}} = 10 ns = 10 ^{-8}s$

    - Maximum lookups $L$ per second:
      $$
      t\_{\text {lookup }}=32 * t\_{\text {access }}=320 n s \rightarrow L=\frac{1}{t\_{\text {lookup }}}=3,125,000 \text { lookups} / s
      $$
      For 100 byte packets, this results in only $2.5$ Gbit/s

  </details>
  
- Optimization

  - [Path compression](#path-compression)
  - [Multibit-Tries](#multibit-trie)

#### Path Compression

- Long sequences of one-child nodes waste memory

  - E.g. highlighted (red) search paths in following trie is not required for branching decision

    ![Êà™Â±è2021-03-01 22.37.07](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-01%2022.37.07.png)

- **üí° Idea: Eliminate those sequences from trie**

- Lookup operation

  - Additional information required

  - Store bit index that has to be examined next

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-01%2022.54.13.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-01 22.54.13" style="zoom:67%;" />

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-01%2022.54.43.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-01 22.54.43" style="zoom:67%;" />

- Evaluation

  - Worst case lookup speed: $O(W)$

    > If there are no one-child nodes on a path, number of nodes to search is equal to length of prefix

  - Memory requirement: $O(N)$ 

    - Maximum of $N$ leaf nodes, $N-1$ for the internal nodes

      $\rightarrow$ Maximum of $2N-1$ entries

    - Improvement against binary trie :clap:

  - Updates: $O(W)$

  </details>
  

#### Multibit Trie

<summary>Example: Homework 03</summary>

</details>

### Hash Tables

- üéØ Obejctives
  - Improve lookup speed

  - Hash tables can perform lookup in $O(1)$
  - However: longest prefix match only with hash table doesn‚Äòt work ü§™
- Instead: **use an *additional* hash table**
  - Stores results of trie lookups
    - E.g., destination IP address 109.21.33.9 $\rightarrow$ output port 2
  - Significant improvement for large forwarding tables üëè
- For each received IP packet
  - Does an entry for destination IP address exist in hash table?
    - Yes $\rightarrow$ no trie lookup
    - No $\rightarrow$ trie lookup
  - Works well if addresses show **‚Äûlocality‚Äú** characteristics
    - I.e., most IP packets are covered by a small set of prefixes
    - Not applicable in the Internet backbone

### Comparsion between Binary Trie, Path Compression, and Multibit Trie

- $N$ = number of prefixes
- $W$ = length of a prefix (e.g., $W=32$ for full IPv4 addresses) 
  - $N \gg W$
- $k$ = length of a stride (only for multibit tries)

|                  | Lookup Speed | Memory Requirement | Update |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------ | ------ |
| Binary trie      | $O(W)$       | $O(NW)$            | $O(W)$ |
| Path compression | $O(W)$       | $O(N)$             | $O(W)$ |
| Multibit trie    |              |                    |        |



### Longest Prefix Matching in Hardware

#### RAM-based Access

- üí°Basic idea
  - Read information with a single memory access 
  - Use destination IP address as RAM address
- üî¥ Problem
  - Independent of number of prefixes in use
    - IPv4 addresses with length of 32 bit $\rightarrow$ requires 4 GByte
    - IPv6 addresses with length of 128 bit $\rightarrow$ requires ~$3.4 √ó 10^{29}$ GByte
  - Waste of memory
    - Required memory size grows *exponentially* with size of address!

#### Content-Addressable Memory (CAM)

**CAM**: takes data and returns address (opposite to RAM)

- CAM can search all stored entries **in a single clock cycle** (very fast!)
- Application for networking: use addresses as search input to perform very fast address lookups (IP $\rightarrow$ output port)

**Structure of CAM**

#### Ternary CAM (TCAM)

- An extension that supports a **‚ÄûDon‚Äòt Care‚Äú State x** (matching both a 0 and a 1 in that position)
  - Allows longest prefix matching
  - Prefixes are stored in the CAM **sorted by prefix length** (from long to short)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-02%2021.57.54.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-02 21.57.54" style="zoom:80%;" />

- üëç Advantage: Very fast lookups (1 clock cycle)
- üî¥ Problems: Severe scalability limitations
  - High energy demand
    - All search words are looked up in parallel 
    - Every core cell is required for every lookup
  - High cost / low density
    - TCAM requires 2-3 times the transistors compared to SRAM
  - Longest matching prefix requires strict ordering of prefixes in the TCAM
    - New entries can require the TCAM to be ‚Äûre-ordered‚Äú
      $\rightarrow$ This can take a significant amount of time!

**üí° Idea:** 

- **Sort prefixes from according to their length (longest to shortest)**
- **CAM part: (prefix, index) pair**
- **RAM part: (index, egress port) pair**

## Router Architecture

Basic components

- **Network interfaces**
  - Realize access to one of the attached networks
  - Functionalities of layers 1 and 2
  - Basic functions of IP
    - Including forwarding table lookup
- **Routing processor**
  - Routing protocol 
  - Management functionality
- **Switch fabric**
  - ‚ÄûBackplane‚Äú
  - Realizes internal forwarding of packets from the input to the output port

### Generic Router Architecture

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-02%2022.03.55.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-02 22.03.55" style="zoom:80%;" />

- Conflicting design goals
  - **High efficiency**
    - Line speed 
    - Low delay
  - Vs. **low cost**
    - Type and amount of required storage 
    - Type of switch fabric

- Blocking 

  - E.g., packets arriving at the same time at different input ports that need the same output port

  - Measures that can help prevent blocking

    - **Overprovisioning**

      Internal circuits in switch fabric operate at a *higher* speed than the individual input ports

    - **Buffering**

      Queue packets at appropriate locations until resources are available At 

      - network interfaces

      - In switch fabric

    - **Backpressure**

      - Signal the overload back towards the input ports 
      - Input ports can then reduce load

    - **Parallel switch fabrics**

      - Allows parallel transport of multiple packets to output ports 
      - Requires higher access speed at output ports

### Buffers

Problem: Simultaneous arrival of multiple packets for an output port

- Sequential processing required, since packets can not be sent in parallel 
- Packets have to be buffered

Example

![Êà™Â±è2021-03-02 22.15.11](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-02%2022.15.11.png)

- Packets arrive at input ports E1 and E2 at the same time, both must be forwarded to output A1
- One out of the two packets requires buffering

Where to place the memory elements for buffering? 

- [Input buffer](#input-buffer)

- [Output buffer](#output-buffer) 
- [Distributed buffer](#distributed-buffer) 
- [Central buffer](#central-buffer)

#### Evaluation of Alternatives

- Parameters of switch fabric
  - $N$: Number of input and output ports
  - $M$: Total storage capacity
  - $S$: Speedup factor of the switch fabric
    - According to the speed of the input and output ports
  - $Z$: Cycle time of memory accesses
    - According to the transmission time of a packet at input and output ports
  - Delay und jitter (=variance of the delay)
- Important
  - Additional mechanisms are required, e.g. flow control 
  - Organization of memories, e.g. FIFO or RAM

- In the following: simplifying assumptions 
  - All ports operate at same data rate

  - All packets have same length

#### Input buffer

- üí° Idea: conflict resolution **at input of switch fabric**

  ![Êà™Â±è2021-03-02 22.30.38](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-02%2022.30.38.png)

  -  FIFO buffer per input port
  - Scheduling of inputs, e.g.
    - Round robin, priority controlled, depending on buffer levels, ...
    - Jitter varies
  - Switch fabric internally non-blocking, i.e., no internal conflicts üëè

- Requirements

  - Internal exchange with speed of connections ($S=1$)
  - Cycle time $Z = \frac{1}{2}$ (One packet in, one packet out)

- Characteristics

  - üî¥ Problem: **Head-of-Line blocking**

    Waiting packet at head of the buffer blocks packet behind it that could be serviced

    {{< figure src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Input_Buffer.png" title="Suppose that in the buffer of $I1$,  the 1st packet are going to be sent to $O1$ and the 2nd packet are going to be sent to $O2$. But currently the 1st packet is blocked. This caused that the 2nd packet can not be processed, although $O2$ is not occupied. In other words, the 1st packet **blocks** the 2nd packet." numbered="true" >}}

  - Maximum throughput is 75% for $ùëÅ = 2$ and 58,58% for $ùëÅ \to \infty$

‚Äã	

#### Output buffer

- üí° Idea: conflict resolution **at output of switch fabric**

  ![Êà™Â±è2021-03-02 23.22.21](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-02%2023.22.21.png)	

  - FIFO buffer per output port
  - Switch fabric internally non-blocking, i.e., no internal conflicts

- Requirements

  - Internal switching of packets at $N$ times the speed of the input ports:
    $$
    S = N
    $$

    > Switch fabric internally non-blocking
    >
    > $\rightarrow$ $N$ inputs must be processed at the same time (simultaneously)

  - Switching of $N$ packets during one cycle possible $\Rightarrow$
    $$
    Z = \frac{1}{N + 1}
    $$

    > In worst case, a buffer must take $N$ packets in and send one packet out.

  - Output buffer must be able to accept packets at $N$ times the speed 
  - Input buffer necessary to accept a packet

- Characteristics
  - Maximum throughput near 100%, usually at approx. 80-85% 
  - Good behavior with respect to delay and jitter

#### Distributed buffer

- üí° Idea: conflict resolution **inside switch fabric**

  ![Êà™Â±è2021-03-02 23.35.03](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-02%2023.35.03.png)

  - Switch fabric as matrix
  - FIFO buffer per crosspoint

- Requirements 

  - Matrix structure

  - Internal exchange with speed of connections: $ùëÜ = 1 $
  - Cycle time: $Z = \frac{1}{2}$

- Characteristics

  - No Head-of-Line blocking :clap:

  - Higher memory requirement $M$ than input or output buffering ü§™

#### Central buffer

- üí° Idea: conflict resolution with **shared buffer**

  - All input and output ports are connected to a shared buffer (organization: RAM

    ![Êà™Â±è2021-03-02 23.40.36](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-02%2023.40.36.png)

- Requirements
  - Cycle time $Z = \frac{1}{2N}$
  - Address and control memory
     for address information of packets and control of parallel memory accesses

- Characteristics

  - Significantly lower memory requirements 

  - But: requirements with respect to memory access time are higher ü§™

#### Buffer placement summary

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-02%2023.42.42.png" alt="Êà™Â±è2021-03-02 23.42.42" style="zoom:80%;" />

### Switch fabric

- Four typical **basic structures** 

  - Shared memory

  - [Bus / ring structure](#bus-or-ring-structure)
  - [Crossbar](#crossbar)
  - [Multi-level switching networks](#multi-level-switching-networks)

- **Evaluation**

  - The internal blocking behavior (Blocking / non-blocking)

  - The presence of buffers (Buffered / unbuffered)

  - Topology and number of levels of the switching network and number of possible routes

  - The control principle for packet routing (Self-controlling / table-controlled)

  - The internal connection concept (Connection oriented / connectionless)

#### Bus or ring structure

- üí° Idea

  - Conflict-free access through time-division multiplexing

  - Transmission capacity bus / ring

    - At least the sum of the transmission capacities of all input ports

- Characteristics

  - Easy support for multicast and broadcast

  - Spatial extension of a bus system is limited. Usually low number of connections (up to approx. 16)

#### Crossbar

- üí° Idea: Each input connected to each output via **crossbar**

  ![Êà™Â±è2021-03-03 12.55.14](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-03%2012.55.14.png)

  - $N$ inputs, $N$ outputs $\Rightarrow$ $N^2$ crosspoints

- Characteristics

  - Partial parallel switching of packets possible

  - Multiple packets for the same output $\rightarrow$ Blocking $\to$ Buffering required
  - High wiring costs with a large number of inputs and outputs
    - Mostly limited to 2x2 or 16x16 matrices
  - Especially efficient with packets of the same size

#### Multi-level Switching Networks

From the switching states of an elementary switching matrix

multilevel connection networks can be set up. E.g.,

![Êà™Â±è2021-03-03 13.05.14](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EckoTan0804/upic-repo/master/uPic/Êà™Â±è2021-03-03%2013.05.14.png)

Characteristics

- Less wiring effort than crossbar

- Each input can be connected to each output

- Not all connections possible at the same time 
  - internal blocking possible
